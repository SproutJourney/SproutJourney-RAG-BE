Together, we cultivate a variety of plants and care for different animals, contributing to the well-being of our shared environment. Through mutual aid and collective efforts, we build vibrant and harmonious communities. This unit explores the many facets of our families and communities, highlighting our collaborative work and mutual support. We are dedicated to maintaining and respecting our surroundings, protecting the plants and animals that sustain us with food, clothing, and more. Celebrations, such as melas and festivals, bring us together to play, sing, and dance, while we also express gratitude by respecting the natural elements including the sun, moon, air, water, and soil. Ch 1 Staying together.indd 1 6/24/2024 2:26:15 PM Note to the Teacher This book has four units. Each unit has three chapters. The first unit is about ‘Our Families and Communities’. The key concepts covered in these chapters are listed below. Chapter 1: Family and Friends shows the various members within a family, their interconnected relationships, the mutual support they provide, and the inherent joy of coexisting harmoniously. Chapter 2: Going to the Mela presents the relationship between near and far families and their joyful activities. Families enjoy visiting the mela, where they explore various materials, encounter different people, engage in activities, and enjoy the fun-filled atmosphere together. They also find out how all families in a community help each other and stay happy. Chapter 3: Celebrating Festivals shows a variety of food, dresses, and cultural practices that people enjoy during festivals. People of all ages take part in community festivals with great joy and celebrate the festivals together. • Collect relevant, local and no cost learning teaching materials (LTM) for activities.

Ch 1 Staying together.indd 2 6/24/2024 2:26:16 PM 1 Family and Friends Playing Together Namaste! Welcome to my home! My name is Bela. I have two brothers — Banku Bhaiya and little Bishu. We enjoy playing chhupan-chhupai outside together. Do you know how to play chhupan-chhupai (hide and seek)? Ch 1 Staying together.indd 3 6/24/2024 2:26:23 PM Chapter At home we all love to play peek-a-boo* with Bishu. We play in the open space outside our house. We have planted a garden with several flowering plants. Our relatives, friends and neighbours also visit our garden. They sit, talk, share jokes and laugh together. Sometimes, when my father and mother are tired after a hard day’s work, they sit and relax here too. All of us enjoy spending our evenings together. *Peek-a-boo is a game played with a young child, which involves hiding and suddenly reappearing, saying ‘peek-a-boo!’ 4 5 Ch 1 Staying together.indd 4 6/24/2024 2:26:28 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Singing Together On rainy days, we sit under a small shelter we have created in the garden. It is great fun to sit outside when it rains. We play games like antakshari and snakes and ladders. My mother and grandmother, whom we call Dadiji, make hot pakodas and tea during the rains. All of us including our grandparents sit together and enjoy the pakodas. Many times, my Dadiji sings songs about the rain. She has taught us a few of the songs, so we join in the singing too. A Rain Song Look at the dark clouds in the sky, The rain will come by and by, Oh, how we love to soak in the rain, See raindrops on the window panes. Paper boats we see in puddles, Birds on trees together huddled, Peacocks dance with feathers bright, Oh, what a beautiful rainy sight. — Inspired by a folk song 4 5 Ch 1 Staying together.indd 5 6/24/2024 2:26:32 PM Family and Friends • Who are the members in Bela’s family? • What do and your family members do when it rains? • Can you think of a rain song and sing it with your friends in the class?

He joins us in some of our games too! Shiru joins us and runs around, barking and wagging his tail with joy. Shiru has a special place in our home. He is a member of our family. Our friends love to play with him too. Banku and Bela never hurt Shiru. They share their food with Shiru. Do you know what games your grandparents used to play when they were young?

Share your experience. • Why do you think we should not hurt or tease animals? 8 9 Ch 1 Staying together.indd 8 6/24/2024 2:26:38 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Our family members, friends, neighbours and relatives love us, care for us and support us. There can be parents (mother and father), grandparents (Dadiji and Dadaji), brothers and sisters (like Banku and Bela) and other elders in a family. Everyone loves each other and takes care of each other. Families also love and care for animals, trees and plants. Animals like cows, buffaloes, dogs, parrots, cats and goats can also be part of a family. We should be loving and caring towards animals the way Bela and Banku are towards their pet, Shiru.

The mela is a little far from home; so they need to take a bus. Ch 2 Going to Mela.indd 19 6/24/2024 2:28:06 PM Chapter “What’s happening? You all seem to be very busy?” asked Dadiji. “We are going to the mela, Dadiji. Please come with us!” requested Nita and Radha. “Mela! Oh yes, your mother asked me to come along, too. I would have loved to. But you know my legs hurt,” said Dadiji. Nita’s father joined the conversation. “We have a lot of people with us. Our neighbours, Sneha and Rohit, as well as Mohan Chacha (Paternal uncle) and his family. They are arriving by train today. Don’t worry! We will take care of you.” Dadiji smiled and answered, “Alright, I will come.

In the meantime, Mohan Chacha called them to say that they would meet Nita and her family directly at the mela. They would take a city bus and then an autorickshaw to reach the mela ground. “Wow! There are so many of us. What fun we are going to have!” exclaimed Radha. • What do you think was in the special bag that Nita and Radha’s family carried? • How do you prepare yourself for a trip? 20 21 Ch 2 Going to Mela.indd 21 6/24/2024 2:28:11 PM Going to the Mela On the way to the Mela Sneha and Rohit are not just Nita’s neighbours; they are close friends too.

There was a seat reserved for older people. Dadiji sat comfortably in it. Everyone boarded the bus and sat all around Dadiji. Rohit’s father insisted on buying the tickets for everyone. “Five full and four half tickets please,” he said to the conductor. He told the children to sit on their seats and not jump around. He also asked them not to put their hands or head out of the window for their safety. The bus went through the city and finally reached the big ground where the mela was being held. 22 23 Ch 2 Going to Mela.indd 23 6/24/2024 2:28:16 PM Going to the Mela • What transport do you take to travel within your city/town/village? • Why should safety measures be followed when travelling by bus, car or while riding a bicycle?

But before you eat you need to wash your hands properly.” The children went to the water point and washed their hands. They all ate gol gappas, chaat, chhole kulche, hot jalebis with rabri, kulfi and many other delicious things. After eating, they made sure they put all the waste in the dustbin. As they were leaving the mela, Dadiji exclaimed, “Look children! Who is accompanying the police officer?” All the children answered together, “Dadiji, it is a police dog!” Kumbh Mela is the world’s biggest festival. It is the largest gathering of mankind and is held on the banks of rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari and Shipra.

Nita’s father joined the conversation. “We have a lot of people with us. Our neighbours, Sneha and Rohit, as well as Mohan Chacha (Paternal uncle) and his family. They are arriving by train today. Don’t worry! We will take care of you.” Dadiji smiled and answered, “Alright, I will come. Have you filled up your water bottles?” 6/24/2024 2:28:08 PM Going to the Mela “Oh yes, Dadii! Our special bag is ready too,” Nita replied. The children jumped with joy. . Everybody was very happy that Dadiji had agreed to come. Nita’s father called out to their neighbours asking them to be ready on time. In the meantime, Mohan Chacha called them to say that they would meet Nita and her family directly at the mela.

We help each other and enjoy observing the different features and behaviours of the plants and animals around us. The more we watch them, learn about the more we lives. This their curiosity drives us to explore further, discovering new and things. Recognising exciting and respecting the well-being of both plants and animals is essential for maintaining ecological balance and fostering a more compassionate society. fascinating Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 45 6/24/2024 2:35:04 PM Note to the Teacher This unit is about ‘Life Around Us’. The key concepts covered in these chapters are listed below. Chapter 4: Getting to Know Plants introduces us to the diverse range of plants that thrive in our surroundings. Through observation, individuals become familiar with their physical features, importance, and diversity. They harness their creativity by utilising their leaves, flowers, fruits, and other parts of the plant. Additionally, they explore the essential requirements for a plant’s survival and take proactive steps to nurture them, ensuring they receive the necessary care and sustenance. Chapter 5: Plants and Animals Live Together shows the relation between plants and animals, by exploring their innate ability to support each other through observation. Individuals explore the diverse range of animals in their surroundings, studying their habits and habitats. Emphasising harmony, they prioritise nurturing the soil, animals, and plants, fostering a balanced coexistence within the shared ecosystem. Chapter 6: Living in Harmony shows us that we are all deeply connected to plants and animals. Some of these plants and animals reside near our homes, while others dwell at a distance. It is essential to extend kindness to all living beings, nurturing and caring for them. By fostering balance and harmony in our interactions with nature, we pave the way for collective happiness and well-being. • Have a display of animal mobiles, masks hanging from the ceiling; create animals and green areas using miniatures of animals and potted plants. • Prepare flash cards of animals, birds, insects, flowers, and plants. • Keep handy authentic and age-appropriate short videos and films, storybooks and poems related to the above concepts. • Visits and Visitors: Plan a visit to a nature park, farm, animal shelter, or plant nursery, or visit professionals working there who can talk to the children. Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 46 6/24/2024 2:35:06 PM 4 Getting to Know Plants So Many Kinds of Plants Gopu, Simmi and Raj walk to school every day. On the way they see beautiful flowers, mountains and streams. One day, Gopu exclaimed, “Isn’t nature just amazing? There are so many kinds of plants, birds and insects ... I wonder if they all have stories to tell!” Simmi agreed, “Yes, the plants come in so many sizes and shapes: very tiny, small, large, bushy …” Raj added, “Thin and curvy, straight and tall ...!” Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 47 6/24/2024 2:35:08 PM Chapter Gopu said, “Some leaves are rough and some smooth. I love to touch and smell them.” Simmi said, “Look, this jamun tree has nice thick and shiny leaves! Isn’t it your special tree, Raj?” Raj agreed, “Yes, it is! You remember its tiny white flowers? And remember the little green fruits, which in a few days turned red and then purple? We enjoyed plucking the ripe purple fruits from the tree!” Simmi smiled, “It’s such fun to walk under the cool shade of these trees.” Trees have a big trunk of wood and many branches that spread out with leaves on them. Trees have roots that go deep down into the soil.

Try to remember where you have seen these trees. Which of these trees have you seen near your home or on your way to school? Shrubs “All plants don’t grow tall like trees. Look at this plant with pretty red flowers. It doesn’t have a big trunk like a tree,” said Gopu. “Instead, it has many brown, woody stems,” added Raj. “These bushy-looking plants are called shrubs. Our tulsi plant at home is a shrub,” informed Simmi. Shrubs are medium-sized plants with several woody stems and branches growing close to the ground. 48 49 Hibiscus Rose Holy Basil (tulsi) Curry leaf Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 49 6/24/2024 2:35:14 PM Getting to know plants The pulses (dal) we eat — toor (pigeon peas), masoor (red lentils), moong (green gram) and urad (black gram) — are all seeds of shrubs. Toor Masoor Moong Urad • Write the names of some shrubs. Have you seen any of the shrubs shown in the pictures above? • Do you know what they are called in your mother tongue? Herbs and Grasses “We have mint and tomato plants at home. Their stems are soft and green”, said Raj. “My grandmother told me that plants with tender stems that do not become woody are called herbs”, added Gopu. Simmi pointed to the grass, “Look at all these different grasses. They too have soft, green stems. Their leaves are long, thin and flat.” 50 51 Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 50 6/24/2024 2:35:17 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 “You’re right Simmi! Do you think grasses are types of herbs too?” enquired Gopu. Herbs are smaller plants with soft stems that do not become woody. Grasses are types of herbs. The leaves of grasses are thin and flat and their stems are hollow. Watch for different kinds of grasses around you. How many kinds do you notice? Herbs Mint Tomato Coriander Mustard Grasses 50 Wild Grasses 51 Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 51 6/24/2024 2:35:18 PM Getting to know plants The grains you eat — paddy (rice), wheat, bajra, jowar, ragi, etc., are seeds of large grasses! Paddy Wheat Bajra Ragi Jowar Sugarcane and bamboo are tall grasses. Bamboo is a special kind of grass, which stays alive longer than just a year. Sugarcane Bamboo Write the names of some herbs that you have seen and where you have seen them. Climbers and Creepers “Look! There is a vine winding up this tall tree!” exclaimed Raj. Gopu agreed, “Wow yes! My friend George has a money plant in his house. I was surprised to see how it spreads upwards. It looks like it is slowly climbing the wall.” 52 53 Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 52 6/24/2024 2:35:20 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Simmi explained that the money plant has a long and thin stem. It cannot stand up by itself. If it finds nothing to climb on, it just creeps and spreads on the ground. “The pumpkin plant is also like a creeper too. I saw it spreading its branches on the ground,” said Raj. Climbers and Creepers have thin and flexible stems. The plants that grow by climbing on other plants for support are climbers and the plants that grow by creeping along the ground are creepers. Some climbers even take their food from the plant on which they climb.

Remember to look down near your feet as well! • How many kinds of trees, shrubs, herbs, grasses, climbers or creepers can you spot? Note to the Teacher Use the local names of various locally available plants. The difference between creepers and climbers may be demonstrated by showing children the real plants. Remember that some plants can behave either like climbers or creepers depending on the structural support available to them. 54 55 Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 54 6/24/2024 2:35:23 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 2 Make friends with a Plant! Choose one plant, preferably a shrub with a thick stem or a tree that you want to make friends with. You can do this by yourself or with a group of your classmates. Name your plant, just like you might name a pet. Take care of the plant by watering it each day. Also protect it as your friend. Now observe your plant friend closely. Here are a few things to observe — its leaves, flowers and fruits. Are there many, a few or no leaves, flowers and fruits? Record your observations in the table on the next page. Time and date of observation: ___________________________ Month: ___________________________________________________ Weather on the day you are recording this information: ____________________________________________ Visit your plant friend as often as you can and observe it carefully. 54 55 Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 55 6/24/2024 2:35:23 PM Getting to know plants Plant parts Many, a few or none Colour Shape (describe or draw) Any other observation Leaves Flowers Fruits 3 • Do you find new leaves growing on the plant? Do the colours of the leaves change as they grow larger? • Do the old brown leaves fall to the ground? • Do you find flowers appearing or notice any fruit? • What are other observations you have?

I have noticed that tulsi, coriander, curry leaves, mint and lemon grass all have wonderfully different smells,” Raj told Simmi. Simmi told Raj, “Have you ever rubbed a mango leaf and smelled it? I love the smell.” Raj added, “This conversation reminds me of the lovely smell of mangoes! My brother is not able to see but he can immediately smell any fruits nearby, like mango, pineapple, jackfruit, guava or jamun.” 5 Blindfold yourself while your friend gradually brings a fruit close to you. From how far can you recognise the fruit with your eyes closed? Now repeat the same experiment with pieces of cut fruit. Was it easier to recognise cut fruit by the smell rather than the whole (uncut) fruit? Which fruit could you smell from farthest away? Try this experiment at home too. 56 57 Ch 4 Getting to know palnts.indd 57 6/24/2024 2:35:25 PM Getting to know plants Parts of a Plant While learning about plants we used the names of many parts of plants, like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds.

We help each other and enjoy observing the different features and behaviours of the plants and animals around us. The more we watch them, the more we learn about their fascinating lives.

Recognising {.) and respecting the well-being of both plants and animals f Se Ay bo Shia, is essential for maintaining Bese ae,” ecological balance and fosteringar? - G82 0 “COS Vl a more compassionate society. This unit is about ‘Life Around Us’. The key concepts covered in these chapters are listed below. Getting to Know Plants introduces us to the diverse range of plants that thrive in our surroundings. Through observation, individuals become familiar with their physical features, importance, and diversity. They harness their creativity by utilising their leaves, flowers, fruits, and other parts of the plant. Additionally, they explore the essential requirements for a plant’s survival and take proactive steps to nurture them, ensuring they receive the necessary care and sustenance. Plants and Animals Live Together shows the relation between plants and animals, by exploring their innate ability to support each other through observation. Individuals explore the diverse range of animals in their surroundings, studying their habits and habitats. Emphasising harmony, they prioritise nurturing the soil, animals, and plants, fostering a balanced coexistence within the shared ecosystem. Living in Harmony shows us that we are all deeply connected to plants and animals. Some of these plants and animals reside near our homes, while others dwell at a distance. It is essential to extend kindness to all living beings, nurturing and caring for them. By fostering balance and harmony in our interactions with nature, ~ we pave the way for collective Have a display of animal mobiles, masks hanging from the ceiling; create animals and green areas using miniatures of animals and potted plants. Prepare flash cards of animals, birds, insects, flowers, and plants. Keep handy authentic and age-appropriate short videos and films, storybooks and poems related to the above concepts. Visits and Visitors: Plan a visit to a nature park, farm, animal shelter, or plant nursery, or visit professionals working there who can talk to the children.

We take care of some animals and plants in our homes by giving them water, food and shelter. Note to the Teacher Emphasise on not hurting animals even if we do not like or are scared of them. Animals generally do not hurt others unless they feel threatened by us. 74 75 Ch 6 Living in Harmony.indd 74 6/24/2024 2:41:41 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 The Mango Tree One day Shambhu, a little boy, was going through the forest with his father. They sat under the shade of a huge mango tree. The mango tree was home to birds, squirrels, monkeys and many other animals. Shambhu saw a monkey eating a mango and throwing out the seed. He told his father about it. His father said, “Shambhu, do you know that a new plant would emerge from this seed? This is how animals and plants help each other.” 74 75 Ch 6 Living in Harmony.indd 75 6/24/2024 2:41:46 PM Living in Harmony Shambhu ran to pick up a mango that dropped from the tree. He said, “Look! I too have got a mango.” “Not only fruits, we get vegetables and many other things from plants,” said Shambhu’s father. “Oh yes, I now remember that you had told this to me earlier. We get medicines, fibre for clothes and wood for our houses from plants.” Shelter for animals Shade Wood Medicine Uses of Plants Fibre Fruit Fresh air 76 77 Ch 6 Living in Harmony.indd 76 6/24/2024 2:41:47 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 • How are we dependent on plants and animals? • How do plants help animals? • How do animals help plants? • How do you look after plants and animals in your surroundings? • How do animals and plants depend on us? Thousands of trees are accidentally planted by squirrels. They bury nuts and then forget where they hid them. Like this, many animals and plants maintain harmony and balance in various ways. We Need Each Other Just as we provide care, protection, food and shelter to animals and plants, we get lots of things from them too. For example, from cows, buffaloes and goats, we get milk and loving company. That is why we respect these animals so much and we treat them with kindness, care and compassion. Animals and plants also depend on each other for food and shelter. Animals help plants by dispersing seeds and making the soil fertile through their waste. This helps plants to grow and spread near and far. We also depend on plants and animals for food, shelter, clothing and companionship. Note to the Teacher After collecting all the points, consolidate, summarise, and explain the terms ‘dispersing’ and ‘fertile’ in simple words. 76 77 Ch 6 Living in Harmony.indd 77 6/24/2024 2:41:47 PM Living in Harmony 1 Get to Know an Animal • Observe the animals around you. • Choose any animal that you see often, such as a goat, cow, dog, cat or bird like a crow, pigeon, sparrow, parrot or duck. • Observe it closely whenever you get a chance. You can also keep a bowl of water and some grains for it. Write a short description of the animal or bird— • Name and describe the animal or bird that you have chosen. • When and where did you first see it? • Was it there alone or with its friends? • Describe its movement. • What sounds did it make? • Did you see it eating, sleeping, talking to its friends or maybe fighting sometimes? • Did it do anything that surprised you or made you laugh? • Share your story with your classmates. 78 79 Ch 6 Living in Harmony.indd 78 6/24/2024 2:41:48 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 2 Busy, Busy, Busy and Clever Ants! You may do this activity near your plant friend, in your classroom or at home. Bring small amounts of three types of food from your kitchen: • Sweet like sugar or jaggery; • Fried like a papad or murukku; • Boiled or cooked like bread, chapati, idli, rice or ragi. Keep these three types of food on the floor in a straight line with one foot distance between them. Make a Guess • Who will come for the food? • Which will be their favourite food? • Will any ants come to your food? • Where would they come from? • Will all the ants look the same? • What food item will they go to first? • How many ants will come to the food? • What will they do with the food? Visiting your plant friend When you are feeling sad, upset or angry you can go to your plant friend and talk to it about how you are feeling. Note to the Teacher Young children should be encouraged to make friends with a tree. It is a very powerful and effective method for developing empathy. For young children who are more reserved and quiet, this activity can help them share their feelings. 78 79 Ch 6 Living in Harmony.indd 79 6/24/2024 2:41:50 PM Living in Harmony You can also talk to your plant when you are happy! How did you feel after sharing your feelings with the plant? Plants also need our care and support. So do animals. We can all help each other. 3 Guess Who I Am ? Sit in pairs.

They are precious resources for our healthy living. This unit explores water and food. We must aim to eat healthy meals and drink clean water. Staying clean and exercising helps us feel good and stay healthy. We must also learn to conserve our Earth’s resources for the future. Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 84 6/24/2024 2:52:50 PM Note to the Teacher This unit is about ‘Gifts of Nature’. The key concepts covered in these chapters are described below. Chapter 7: Water — A Precious Gift highlights how rainfall provides us with the precious gift of water, which is then stored in different ways. We ensure the cleanliness of this water and distribute it to households. Each household stores water for daily use, employing it in numerous ways. However, challenges arise regarding both the quality and quantity of water. To address these issues, we implement various measures aimed at conserving water resources. Chapter 8: Food We Eat helps us understand the vital role of food in maintaining our health. We consume a diverse range of foods obtained from various sources. Each food item provides essential nutrients that benefit our bodies in unique ways. Our various cultures possess valuable knowledge about the nutritional value of different foods and offer guidance on making healthy dietary choices. the Chapter 9: Staying Healthy and Happy emphasises importance of maintaining cleanliness and good health. We acquire essential principles of hygiene and cleanliness, ensuring tidiness in our homes and surroundings. Regular exercise becomes a part of our routine, promoting both physical fitness and emotional well-being. By understanding and following the established rules and regulations of our environment, we protect ourselves from potential harm. • Plan a ‘Food Mela’ in the class; try to display a variety of food items, e.g., grains, spices, fruits, vegetables, etc. • Organise an exhibition on a variety of containers and vessels used to store water; you can display pictures too. • Keep handy authentic and age–appropriate short videos and films, storybooks and poems food, water, related to cleanliness and healthy habits. for visit • Visits or Visitors: Plan a different to sources of water in your neighbourhood with Invite a yoga safety. instructor to demonstrate yogasanas good health; invite a health talk practitioner to the children about maintaining cleanliness and invite hygiene; parents and community members to share and talk about their traditional cuisines during the food mela. to Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 85 6/24/2024 2:52:51 PM 7 Water – A Precious Gift Rain, Rain, Come again! 86 87 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 86 6/24/2024 2:52:53 PM Chapter What comes down, But never goes up? Watch the sky every day for a week. Will it rain? Your guess may be right on some days, and on some days it may be wrong. Are there any clues that help you guess if it will rain? Ask an elder about how they guess. Write down the clues. I think it will rain today because … (write at least 2 clues) _____________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________ I think it will not rain today because … (write at least 2 clues) _____________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________ Here Comes the rain! Note to the Teacher The first part of this chapter can be done whenever it rains in your area. Children may freely observe, question, make guesses, discuss, draw and record their observations. 86 87 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 87 6/24/2024 2:52:55 PM Water—A Precious Gift 1 Ask yourself as many questions as you can about the rain. • Is it a heavy rain or a light one? • Are the raindrops big or small? • Do they come down fast or slow? • Is the rain so heavy that you do not see the water drops, but only lines or sheets of water? • Is the rain falling straight down? Is it slanting or changing its direction? Guess why. • Collect the rainwater in a vessel. Does it look clean or dirty? • Draw a picture of the rain that you observed. 2 88 89 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 88 6/24/2024 2:52:59 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 • Do you think it will rain again today? Or tomorrow? Why do you think so? • Did it rain only in your area or in other nearby places as well? Make a guess, then ask and find out. • Find some songs about the rain or make up one, in your language or any other. Sing some songs about the rain. • Did the rain make you happy? Did it make everyone happy? What happened to the rainwater? When it rained, a lot of water fell to the ground. Where did all this water go? Here is the rain falling on different surfaces. Imagine what happens to the rainwater on different surfaces. Does the rainwater get absorbed into the soil, collect in puddles or flow away? Have you ever wondered whether it joins a small stream or a river? What happens after the rain stops and the sun comes out? What happens to all this water? Make your own guesses. When rainwater gets soaked into the soil, it may slowly flow under the soil to join a stream or a pond. Some of the water gets stored under the ground between the rocks and the soil. The water in our wells comes from this underground water. Water flowing in a stream later joins rivers. Some of the water gathers in puddles, ponds and lakes and also in the seas and oceans. 88 89 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 89 6/24/2024 2:53:00 PM Water—A Precious Gift • Is there a stream, river, pond or lake near your village or city? Find out its name and some information about it. Visit it and draw its picture. Draw any trees, birds or animals that you see around it. • Find a poem about a river and sing it in the class. Water is a precious gift! Water is a gift that falls from the sky. This gift reaches our homes in special ways. How do we care for this gift? How do we store it? What do we do with it? Let us go indoors and find out. On most days, Surya and Barkha get water from the taps at home. At school too, they get water from taps. All these taps get water through pipes. From where does the water come into these pipes? Surya and Barkha followed the pipes and found that there was a tank on the roof. Now they are puzzled with how the water came into the tank in the first place. Note to the Teacher The water cycle will be introduced only in Class 4. For now, let children notice that water remaining on hard surfaces gets dried up in the sun. Rainwater that sinks in the soil is most important, as it recharges our sources of water and helps plants grow. 90 91 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 90 6/24/2024 2:53:01 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Where do you get water from? Do you get water from a tap? If yes, ask the elders in your home from where the water comes into the tap. They may tell you about a tank high up on the terrace or some distance away. Did you find out about any tanks where the water is stored? How did water reach those tanks? Are there some bigger pipes which bring the water to this tank? Where do these pipes come from? Do you get water from a well or a borewell? Observe how water is drawn from the well. It could be using a pulley or a hand pump or an electric pump. Guess again where the water in the well comes from. Does someone bring the water to your home from a tap or a well or from a river or lake some distance away? Who carries this water? How do they bring it? Say a big ‘thank you’ to the people who bring you the water! • Do you get water delivered in a tanker? If yes, find out where the tankers bring water from. Does your water come from a well, river or lake near your village or city? • Do you know anyone who faces difficulty in getting water every day? 90 91 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 91 6/24/2024 2:53:04 PM Water—A Precious Gift Water in Our Daily Lives • List all the activities you can think of for which we need water. • How many mugs of water do you need to brush your teeth? How much water do you use to take a shower? Have you ever faced a situation when you did not get any water? What did you do then? One day it happened to Surya and Barkha too. Do you know what they did? Storing Water No water today! Oh no! We have stored two buckets of water. Storing Water The society pipeline burst today. 92 93 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 92 6/24/2024 2:53:07 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Ask your grandparents or any elder: • How did they get water? Did they use water in the same way as you do? • How did they store water? • Write a short story about what you found out. When we know that we do not get water all the time then we store it. In some places, people do not get running water through taps and pipes in their homes. They have to bring the water from a river or well. Sometimes it is delivered through water tankers and stored at home. Many years ago, there were no pipes or taps anywhere in the world. So people to make containers or vessels to store water. Here are some vessels that we use now-a-days for storing water at home. They are made of different materials. learned Clay pot Clay surahi Copper vessel Brass pot Steel pot Aluminium pot Glass bottle Plastic bottle Plastic bucket 92 93 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 93 6/24/2024 2:53:09 PM Water—A Precious Gift 3 Put up an exhibition • Identify different vessels used to keep water in your home. • Ask the elders in your family what types of vessels they stored water in. • Were they different from what we use now? • Did the vessels have different names? • On a separate sheet of paper draw a picture of any vessel that you find interesting and write its name in your language. • Put up an exhibition of these pictures in your classroom with the help of your teacher. • Walk around and observe the drawings by your classmates. • How many different kinds of vessels have been drawn? • Did you find any patterns on the vessels? 94 95 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 94 6/24/2024 2:53:10 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Stop for a Moment and think! • Water comes down to earth as rain. • It slowly fills up our many sources— streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, wells, groundwater, etc. • From these sources we bring water to our homes in many ways. • We store it in many ways. • We use it in many ways. • What happens to water after we use it? Water helps us in keeping things clean. This is very important for our health. But after we use it, the water becomes dirty. We cannot use dirty water for drinking or cooking. But we can reuse the waste water for watering our plants or for flushing toilets. Let us strive to reduce our use of water and reuse water whenever possible. We should not add too much soap and other such chemicals in water. Let us take care of this precious gift from the sky! 94 95 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 95 6/24/2024 2:53:12 PM Water—A Precious Gift Every Drop Counts Water is considered sacred because it is absolutely essential for our survival. We cannot live more than 3 days without drinking water. This is the reason we first offer water to people who come to our home. In some places, where it rains very little and there are no big water bodies, people have to walk for long distances to get water. Don’t you think everyone must get clean drinking water anywhere, anytime? Take Action Offer clean drinking water to whoever comes to your door. It could be people who provide us postal or sanitation services. In many places, there is a tradition of keeping pots of water outside homes so that anybody feeling thirsty can have water. This is particularly so in the hot summer months. Free drinking water for people Drinking water for animals in a tank A birdbath 96 97 Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 96 6/24/2024 2:53:14 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 4 Prepare a birdbath — offer water to birds in the hot summer months. A birdbath contains water in a shallow plate for birds to drink and cool down. • Take a shallow and wide container (an old big bowl or a base of an old pot or a bucket, less than 10 cm deep) • Keep some stones in it for birds to perch. You may make the sides sloping by adding some smaller pebbles.

The key concepts covered in these chapters are described below. Water — A Precious Gift highlights how rainfall provides us with the precious gift of water, which is then stored in different ways. We ensure the cleanliness of this water and distribute it to households. Each household stores water for daily use, employing it in numerous ways. However, challenges arise regarding both the quality and quantity of water. To address these issues, we implement various measures aimed at conserving water resources. Food We Eat helps us understand the vital role of food in maintaining our health. We consume a diverse range of foods obtained from various sources. Each food item provides essential nutrients that benefit our bodies in unique ways. Our various cultures possess valuable knowledge about the nutritional value of different foods and offer guidance on making healthy dietary choices. Staying Healthy and Happy emphasises the importance of maintaining cleanliness and good health. We acquire essential principles of hygiene and cleanliness, ensuring tidiness in our homes and surroundings. Regular exercise becomes a part of our routine, promoting both physical fitness and emotional well-being. By understanding and following the established rules and regulations of our environment, we protect ourselves from potential harm. Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 85 Plan a ‘Food Mela’ in the class; try to display a variety of food items, e.g., grains, spices, fruits, vegetables, etc. Organise an exhibition on a variety of containers and vessels used to store water; you can display pictures too. Keep handy authentic and age-appropriate short videos and films, storybooks and poems related to food, water, cleanliness and healthy habits. Visits or Visitors: Plan a visit to different sources of water in your neighbourhood with safety. Invite a yoga instructor to demonstrate yogasanas for good health; invite a health practitioner to talk to the children about maintaining cleanliness and hygiene; invite parents and community members to share and talk about their traditional cuisines during the food mela. 6/24/2024 2:52:51 PM | Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 86 6/24/2024 2:52:53 PM Water—A Precious Gift What comes down, But never goes up? Watch the sky every day for a week. Will it rain? Your guess may be right on some days, and on some days it may be wrong. Are there any clues that help you guess if it will rain? Ask an elder about how they guess. Write down the clues. I think it will rain today because ... (write at least 2 clues) I think it will not rain today because ... (write at least 2 clues) Here Comes the. Rain! Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 87 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Ask yourself as many questions as you can about the rain. e Is it a heavy rain or a light one? e Are the raindrops big or small? ¢ Do they come down fast or slow? e Is the rain so heavy that you do not see the water drops, but only lines or sheets of water? e Is the rain falling straight down? Is it slanting or changing its direction? Guess why. e Collect the rainwater in a vessel. Does it look clean or dirty? up e Draw a picture of the rain that you observed. 7 Gift of water.indd 88 - 6/24/2024 2:52:59 PM Water—A Precious Gift What happened to the rainwater? When it rained, a lot of water fell to the ground. Where did all this water go? Here is the rain falling on different surfaces. Imagine what happens to the rainwater on different surfaces. Does the rainwater get absorbed into the soil, collect in puddles or flow away? Have you ever wondered whether it joins a small stream or a river? What happens after the rain stops and the sun comes out? What happens to all this water? Make your own guesses. When rainwater gets soaked into the soil, itmay slowly flow under the soil to join astream or a pond. Some of the water gets stored 99» /.. under the ground between the rocks and the pe soil. The water in our wells comes from this underground water. Water flowing in a stream later joins rivers. Some of the water gathers in puddles, ponds and lakes and also in the seas and oceans. Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 89 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Water is a Precious Gift! Water is a gift that falls from the sky. This gift reaches our homes in special ways. How do we care for this gift? How do we store it? What do we do with it? Let us go indoors and find out. On most days, Surya and Barkha get water from the taps at home. At school too, they get water from taps. All these taps get water through pipes. From where does the water come into these pipes? Surya and Barkha followed the pipes and found that there was a tank on the roof. Now they are puzzled with how the water came into the tank in the first place. 6/24/2024 2:53:01 PM Water—A Precious Gift ® g.\\ Discuss Where do you get water from? € Do you get water from a tap? If yes, ask the elders in your home from where the water comes into the tap. They may tell you about a tank high up on the terrace or some distance away. 0 ° Did you find out about any tanks where the water is stored? How did water reach those tanks? Are there some bigger pipes which bring the water to this tank? Where do these pipes come from? Do you get water from a well or a borewell? Observe how water is drawn from the well. It could be using a pulley or a hand pump or an electric pump. Guess again where the water in the well comes from. Does someone bring the water to your home from a tap or a well or from a river or lake some distance away? Who carries this water? How do they bring it? Say a big ‘thank you’ to the people who bring you the water! Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 91 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Water in Our Daily Lives e List all the activities you can think of for which we need water. e How many mugs of water do you need to brush your teeth? How much water do you use to take a shower? Have you ever faced a situation when you did not get any water? What did you do then? One day it happened to Surya and Barkha too. Do you know what they did? stored two buckets of water. The society pipeline burst today. =| Ch 7 Gift of water.indd ez 2 6/24/2024 2:53:07 PM Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 93 Water—A Precious Gift When we know that we do not get water all the time then we store it. In some places, people do not get running water through taps and pipes in their homes. They have to bring the water from a river or well. Sometimes it is delivered through water tankers and stored at home. Many years ago, there were no pipes or taps anywhere in the world. So people learned to make containers or vessels to store water. Here are some vessels that we use now-a-days for storing water at home. They are made of different materials. o 2 Clay pot Clay surahi Copper vessel Brass pot Steel pot Aluminium pot Glass Plastic Plastic bottle bottle bucket Our Wondrous World | Class 3 7 Gift of water.indd 94 am Put up an exhibition Identify different vessels used to keep water in your home. Ask the elders in your family what types of vessels they stored water in. Were they different from what we use now? Did the vessels have different names? On a separate sheet of paper draw a picture of any vessel that you find interesting and write its name in your language. Put up an exhibition of these pictures in your classroom with the help of your teacher. Walk around and observe the drawings by your classmates. How many different kinds of vessels have been drawn? Did you find any patterns on the vessels? 6/24/2024 2:53:10 PM Water—A Precious Gift Stop fora Moment and Think! Water helps us in keeping things clean. This is very important for our health. But after we use it, the water becomes dirty. We cannot use dirty water for drinking or cooking. But we can reuse the waste water for watering our plants or for flushing toilets. Let us strive to reduce our use of water and reuse water whenever possible. We should not add too much soap and other such chemicals in water. Let us take care of this precious gift from the sky! Ch 7 Gift of water.indd 95 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Every Drop Counts Water is considered sacred because it is absolutely essential for our survival. We cannot live more than 3 days without drinking water. This is the reason we first offer water to people who come to our home. In some places, where it rains very little and there are no big water bodies, people have to walk for long distances to get water. Don’t you think everyone must get clean drinking water anywhere, anytime? Take Action Offer clean drinking water to whoever comes to your door. It could be people who provide us postal or sanitation services. In many places, there is a tradition of keeping pots of water outside homes so that anybody feeling thirsty can have water. This is particularly so in the hot people summer months.

Daily routine Write down the activities that you do every day, from the time you wake up, till you go to sleep. Your list should include the activities below. Remember that you do some of these things more than once in the day: • Take a shower • Wash your hands with soap • Brush your teeth • Drink 6 – 8 glasses of water • Eat food • Sleep well for at least 8 hours total • Play outside Check your list for these activities • Do you brush your teeth twice in the day — once after waking up and once before going to bed? • Do you rinse your mouth every time after eating food? • Do you wash your hands with soap after using the toilet and after coming home from outdoors? • If your answer to any of these questions is “No”, think and discuss how you can make it a habit. Is there anything that makes it difficult for you to follow these routines? 110 111 Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 110 6/24/2024 2:58:24 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 How do we brush our Teeth? Moyna’s Dadu (grandfather) uses twigs from a neem or babool tree to clean his teeth. “Dadu! How come you don’t use a toothbrush like us?” asked Moyna. Dadu laughed and said, “Well, every day I get a fresh twig from the trees nearby. I chew it to make a brush and remove food particles stuck between my teeth. It gives my gums a good massage too. You should try it sometime!” Moyna found the neem twig to be too bitter, but the babool twig tasted better. “I might start using babool twigs, Dadu!” exclaimed Moyna. Ask your grandparents or any elderly person in your neighbourhood — What did they use to wash their hair, body and clothes and clean their teeth when they were young? Can these things be found now? 110 111 Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 111 6/24/2024 2:58:26 PM Staying Healthy and Happy The modern idea of brushing teeth came from the Indian hygiene tradition of datun — using twigs of certain plants including neem, karanj, babool, etc., to clean our teeth. 1 Making a home-cleaner using orange and lemon peels We use many cleaning agents at home to remove dirt and germs from surfaces like kitchen slabs, furniture and bathrooms. Find out what home-cleaners are used in your home. You can also make your own eco-friendly cleaner! Here is what you need: • Peels of 8 –12 oranges or lemons, enough to fill a half-litre transparent container. • Ten whole cloves (laung) or 2–3 bay leaves (tejpatta) (optional) • Two cups of white vinegar, enough to cover the peels or spices. Now put all these ingredients in a half litre transparent container and close the lid. Keep the container in a sunny area for about two weeks, occasionally shaking the mixture. Strain the liquid after two weeks and your all purpose cleaner is ready! You can mix a cup of the liquid in one bucket of water to clean floors and bathrooms. Note to the Teacher You can discuss that routines may vary based on where we live and access to resources like water. We have some traditional methods for cleaning. This includes natural cleaning alternatives such as, reetha or Shikakai for the hair and some safe and effective recipes for household cleaning. 112 113 Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 112 6/24/2024 2:58:27 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Animals like to keep themselves clean too! Have you ever seen monkeys sitting and grooming each other? This is a way in which they keep their bodies free from insects. You may have also seen birds using their beaks to clean their feathers. Next time do observe different ways in which animals and insects around you might be cleaning themselves. Playing outdoors and indoors too Have you noticed that, after running fast to catch your friends in a game, you are breathing faster and deeper? Maybe your cheeks are a little red and you are feeling a little warm and start sweating. This is because exercise makes our heart work harder and better. Exercise is good for the body. There are many ways to exercise and keep ourselves fit. 112 113 Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 113 6/24/2024 2:58:30 PM Staying Healthy and Happy 2 Hop, skip, jump! Try the following moves: • Walk like a duck. • Jump like a frog. • Run like a cat. Which moves did you enjoy the most? Take a skipping rope and count as you jump. Do this with your friends and see who can jump the maximum number of times. Then, invite a friend to start jumping after you skip 10 times or after you say a short poem as you skip. For example: I like roti, I like ghee. I want _______________________, (name of a friend) To jump with me! What other games do you play with a skipping rope? Teach and learn from your friends. Note to the Teacher The body requires mainly three types of exercises — strengthening the cardio-respiratory system; adding strength to the muscles and bones; and maintaining or enhancing body flexibility. 114 115 Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 114 6/24/2024 2:58:31 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Harpreet’s grandmother cannot move much because of the pain in her knees.

Write Make your weekly health table. What makes you feel sleepy, hungry or tired? Feelings are the body’s way of telling us that something is amiss. We all have different needs. We should each know what is good for our body and mind. For this, track your activities for a week and observe how you feel. Day Did I brush my teeth twice? Did I use the toilet in the morning? Did I take shower? How much time did I sleep? What did I have for break- fast? How long did I watch TV or play on the phone? How long did I play out- doors? How did it make me feel? (Good, okay, not so good, bad) Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Note to the Teacher You may encourage children to find patterns and make connections between good sleep, diet and exercise and feeling good. Also discuss whether children find any of the healthy activities difficult to follow regularly. Completing the table is a form of assessment for the chapter. 118 119 Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 119 6/24/2024 2:58:38 PM Staying Healthy and Happy B. Draw Draw a big circle in your notebook and divide it into 24 slices. Imagine that each slice is one hour of the day. Now colour these slices differently based on the number of hours you spend doing different activities in one entire day of 24 hours. For example, Moyna spends 8 hours sleeping, 2 hours eating, 6 hours in school or studying at home, 2 hours playing outside, 2 hours helping her parents at home, 1 hour watching TV or playing on the phone, 1 hour in the toilet and 2 hours on other activities. This is what Moyna’s circle looked like. Sleeping Eating Studying Playing Helping parents Watching TV Using the toilet Other activities C. Discuss Think of one activity you would like to do at least twice a week to improve your stamina. It could be running, jumping, climbing stairs or anything else. Discuss it with your friends and try doing such activities together. Note to the Teacher One simple way to divide a circle into 24 parts by hand (approximately, without using a protractor) is to first divide it into four quarters, then divide each quarter into 3 equal parts. At this point, there would be 12 equal sections. To make 24 sections, divide each section into two equal parts. This intuitive drawing exercise would also later connect with fractions and proportions, as well as drawing a clock and the Ashok Chakra on a flag.

Daily Routine Write down the activities that you do every day, from the time you wake up, till you go to sleep. Your list should include the activities below. Remember that you do some of these things more than once in the day: 2 ¢ Take a shower e Wash your hands with soap ¢ Brush your teeth e Drink 6-8 glasses of water e Eat food e Sleep well for at least 8 hours total e Play outside Check your list for these activities e Do you brush your teeth twice in the day — once after waking up and once before going to bed? e Do you rinse your mouth every time after eating food? e Do you wash your hands with soap after using the toilet and after coming home from outdoors? e If your answer to any of these questions is “No”, think and discuss how you can make it a habit. Is there anything that makes it difficult for you to follow these routines? 6/24/2024 2:58:24 PM Staying Healthy and Happy How do we Brush our Teeth? Moyna’s Dadu (grandfather) uses twigs from a neem or babool tree to clean his teeth. “Dadu! How come you don’t use a toothbrush like us?” asked Moyna. Dadu laughed and said, “Well, every day I get a fresh twig from the trees nearby. I chew it to makea brush and remove food particles stuck between my teeth. It gives my gums a good massage too. You 1” should try it sometime Moyna found the neem twig to be too bitter, but the babool twig tasted better. “I might start using babool twigs, Dadu!” exclaimed Moyna. Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 111 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 2°- \\Do you know? The modern idea of brushing teeth came from the Indian hygiene tradition of datun — using twigs of certain plants including neem, karanj, babool, etc., to clean our teeth. Making a home-cleaner using orange and lemon peels We use many cleaning agents at home to remove dirt and germs from surfaces like kitchen slabs, furniture and bathrooms. Find out what home-cleaners are used in your home. You can also make your own eco-friendly cleaner! Here is what you need: e Peels of 8-12 oranges or lemons, Oe enough to fill a half-litre transparent container. 2. > e Ten whole cloves (laung) or 2-3 bay leaves (tejpatta) (optional) ¢ Two cups of white vinegar, enough to cover the peels or spices. Now put all these ingredients in a half litre transparent container and close the lid. Keep the container in a sunny area for about two weeks, occasionally shaking the mixture. Strain the liquid after two weeks and your all purpose cleaner is ready! You can mix a cup of : the liquid in one bucket of water to clean floors and bathrooms. 6/24/2024 2:58:27 PM Staying Healthy and Happy Animals like to keep themselves clean too! Have you ever seen monkeys sitting and grooming each other? This is a way in which they keep their bodies free from insects. You may have also seen birds using their beaks to clean their feathers. Next time do observe different ways in which animals and insects around you might be cleaning themselves. Playing Outdoors and Indoors too Have you noticed that, after running fast to catch your friends in a game, you are breathing faster and deeper? Maybe your cheeks are a little red and you are feeling a little warm and start sweating. This is because exercise makes our heart work harder and better. Exercise is good for the body. There are many ways to exercise and keep ourselves fit. e Ch 9 Staying healthy and happy.indd 113 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Hop, skip, jump! Try the following moves: e Walk like a duck. e Jump like a frog. e Run like a cat. Which moves did you enjoy the most? Take a skipping rope and count as you jump. Do this with your friends and see who can jump the maximum number of times. Then, invite a friend to start jumping after you skip 10 times or after you say a short poem as you skip. For example: I like roti, I like ghee. I want (name of a friend) To jump with me! What other games do you play with a skipping rope?

We will observe these items, learn what they are made of, and discover where they come from. We will delve into the natural resources that provide us with these materials. We will also explore various materials and learn how they are used in different ways. Additionally, we will observe the waste materials around us and learn how to manage them to keep our surroundings clean and healthy. This journey will help us understand and appreciate the resources that we use every day. Ch 10 This world of things.indd 121 6/24/2024 3:02:24 PM • Collect and display a variety of things made of different materials (metal, wood, glass, plastic, clay, etc.). • Visits and visitors: Organise a visit to a porter, local toy maker, etc., or invite them to the school to talk to the children. • Organise an activity for the children to make a dustbin (each for dry and wet waste) in the class from waste materials. • Demonstrate the segregation of waste into dry and wet (e.g., after lunch). Ensure children wear gloves and masks. Note to the Teacher This unit is about ‘Things Around Us’. The key concepts covered in these chapters are described below. Chapter 10: The World of Things helps us to explore the things around us, observe things closely to see what they’re made of and where they come from and learning which things come from nature and which are made by people. Moreover, we explore the diverse properties of various materials. Chapter 11: Making Things helps us to learn about different materials and how they are used. We discover how houses are constructed using natural resources and how people introduce new designs and styles. Moreover, we discuss the importance of always adhering to safety rules. Chapter 12: Taking Charge of Waste emphasises the importance of putting trash in designated areas and sorting it correctly. We also describe the value of reusing and recycling. Furthermore, we explore ways to maintain cleanliness and safety in our homes and neighbourhoods. The use of newspapers or old cloth for gift wrapping is an eco-friendly practice that reduces waste and conserves resources. By creatively utilising such items, we not only reduce our waste but also add a personalised touch to our gifts. Ch 10 This world of things.indd 122 6/24/2024 3:02:28 PM 10 This World of Things Let’s take a Look Around us! Khushi reached school early. Sunlight shone through the windows and the classroom looked bright and beautiful. Khushi wanted to capture this scene in a picture. Here is what she drew. Can you name the things that Khushi has drawn? Write in the boxes given. Do you see the window glass? Why or why not? Ch 10 This world of things.indd 123 6/24/2024 3:02:31 PM Chapter 1 Understand your Classroom Draw a picture of your classroom in your notebook. Label the things that you have drawn. Khushi is curious, “Where have all these things come from? Who has made them? What are they all made of ?” she thought. Let us help Khushi find out. The table and chair are made of wood. Where do we get wood from? The hinges, nails and latches of the door are made of some metals. Metals are carefully extracted from certain rock and sediment (called ‘ore’) dug up from inside the Earth. Note to the Teacher Show the children some common metals around you such as iron, copper, aluminium, gold, silver, mercury in a thermometer or alloys such as steel, brass and bronze. Alloys are mixtures of metals. 124 125 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 124 6/24/2024 3:02:34 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 2 Spot the metals Find as many things or parts of things, that are made of metals. Which metals do you recognise around you? If you do not know the name of the metal, ask your friends or an elder. Make a list of these metals in your notebook. What are other things in the classroom, such as, mats, bulbs and electric switches, made of? See-through materials! Khushi was sitting at her desk. She could see a tree laden with beautiful flowers. She reached out to touch them. Her hand touched the glass pane. At first, Khushi did not the windowpanes. notice They were made of glass and she realised that she had been able to see the flowers and trees through the glass. Glass is like that! • Does your window have a glass pane? • Can you see through it? • What do you see? 124 125 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 125 6/24/2024 3:02:36 PM This World of Things 3 Seeing through things Collect a few small objects of different materials from your surroundings like bottles, papers, cloth and utensils, etc. Look at a light bulb or a candle flame through them. You can see through some objects very clearly, you can partially see through some others, while you cannot see through some objects at all. Order these objects from those you can see through very clearly, to those you cannot see through at all. See through clearly See through partially Cannot see through at all Take care! Never look at the sun continuously — through any object or directly. It will harm your eyes. Things that you can see through are called transparent. Most kinds of glass are transparent. Name one more material that is transparent. 126 127 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 126 6/24/2024 3:02:36 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 You can see through glass, but you cannot see through wood. Materials that you cannot see through are called opaque. Glass is transparent but wood is opaque. Some things are in between — that is, you can see through them only partially. They are called translucent. Find some materials that are translucent. 4 Let us colour the world! Collect two or three see bottles bags, through or thin cloth of different colours. Look at a sheet of white paper through them. • Does the colour of the paper appear to change? • Does white paper appear different when you look at it through thin blue plastic or glass? Or, thin yellow plastic or glass? • Do the colours of different objects appear to change? How did a blue object look through thin yellow plastic? • Have you earlier experienced looking through coloured transparent objects? Try to recall such experiences. 126 127 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 127 6/24/2024 3:02:37 PM This World of Things What is it made of ? Let us return to Khushi’s classroom. Chain game • In the table below, Khushi has grouped objects according to the materials that they are made of. Her list of objects is in the first column of the table. The names of the materials are in the second column. • The third column of the table is for you to complete. Here write the names of some objects you have seen that are made from that material. Some objects around you may be made from materials not in this list, e.g., clay and rubber are missing in Khushi’s list. Use one of these to add an additional row in the table. Khushi’s list Name of the material Objects made of this material which are in your classroom or home Table, chair, door Wood For example, pencil Door hinges, nails, Metal Windowpanes, light bulb Glass Electric switches Plastic Where do all these materials come from? Can you locate their source? For example, Wood — Tree Metals — ___________________ Cloth — ____________________ Glass is mostly made of sand! 128 129 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 128 6/24/2024 3:02:38 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Talk to your grandparents • In their childhood, were these things made of the same materials? • Are there new materials now that they might not have seen before? • Are there any materials that they saw in their childhood that are not in use now? Why? Different materials may look different. Are they also different in other ways? Would you be able to recognise some material even with your eyes closed? • What material is your spoon made of? • Is it made of metal, wood or some other material? Can you guess? • Which of these words or phrases describes the spoon? Smooth Rough Dull Shiny Feels cold to the touch 128 129 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 129 6/24/2024 3:02:39 PM This World of Things 5 Knock on it and it will speak to you! Orchestra Take a metal spoon and at least five objects made up of different materials— wood, metal, plastic, cloth and glass. Gently tap the spoon on each of them. Listen to the sound that each of them makes. Make your own words to describe all these different sounds. Try to capture those sounds in words, like ting-ting, dhum-dhum, dub-dub, … Now compose your own beats. Ting, Ting, Thak, Thak Ting, Thak, Ting, Thak! Does it bend? Khushi’s table is made of wood. What else is used to make tables? Can we use fabric or rubber to make a table? Why or why not? Wood is hard and rigid while fabric is soft and flexible. The flexibility of fabric makes it more suitable to make clothes and curtains. Imagine if clothes were made of wood! Odd Pairs List five objects and pair them with a material that is not suitable for it! Explain why these materials will not work to make these objects. One example is done for you. 130 131 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 130 6/24/2024 3:02:40 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 S. No. Objects material Reasons Umbrella Paper Paper will tear if it gets wet in the rain 1. 2. 3. 4. Does it flow? In her ‘Odd Pairs’, Khushi playfully wrote, “Walls — can’t be made of water.” We don’t make walls of water because they will fall. What else could happen to water walls? We need ‘solid’ things such as stones, bricks or wood to make walls. Things that do not change their shape are called ‘solid’. Water does not keep its shape — it flows. Air flows too, but in a different way. If you pour water into a cup it stays there. Water is a ‘liquid’. Air does not stay in a cup, it just floats in and out. That is because air is a gas. So objects can be classified as solids, liquids and gases. 130 Solid Liquid 131 Gas Ch 10 This world of things.indd 131 6/24/2024 3:02:40 PM This World of Things 6 Let’s group them another way! Here are the names of some objects: ink, a stone, smoke, ice, steam, a spoon, honey, a bottle, a bag, water. If it is a solid, write its name on the tray; if it is a liquid, write its name in the bottle; if it is a gas, write its name in the balloon. Add some of your own objects in the tray, bottle and balloon. Some objects could be confusing, such as sand or a sponge or clay. Identify more such objects and write names of at least three of them. Note to the Teacher Materials like rubber, fibre and wax could be naturally produced by plants and animals, but similar materials are also made artificially. For example, bees produce wax for their honeycomb, but very similar wax can be made from petroleum. Petroleum is a liquid found deep underground. Petrol, rockel, diesel, etc., are extracted from petroleum. Petroleum-based materials, such as petrol, plastic, rubber or paraffin wax, create ‘non- biodegradable’ waste. This concept is just touched upon in Class 3, and details are left to later classes. 132 133 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 132 6/24/2024 3:02:42 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Natural — Artificial Khushi drew a picture of a mango tree with a mango growing on it and a bird sitting on it. The tree, mango and bird are not made by humans but occur naturally in nature. Things that exist naturally are called ‘natural’. Natural things may be alive, like plants and animals, or not alive, like rocks, water and air. Things that are made by people are called ‘artificial’ like clothes, shoes, tables, etc. List out five things in each group. • Natural: ________________________________ • Artificial: _______________________________ In the next chapter we will further explore how things are made. Have you seen trees around you that bear flowers and fruits at special times of the year? If you have ever eaten a ripe mango or seen mangoes in the market or watched a mango tree through the year, try to guess— at what time of the year did Khushi draw her picture? Could it be around January or around June? 132 133 Ch 10 This world of things.indd 133 6/24/2024 3:02:44 PM This World of Things Let us reflect A.

How did a blue object look through thin yellow plastic? e Have you earlier experienced looking through coloured transparent objects? Try to recall such experiences. Ch 10 This world of things.indd 127 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 What is it made of ? Let us return to Khushi’s classroom. Chain Game e In the table below, Khushi has grouped objects according to the materials that they are made of. Her list of objects is in the first column of the table. The names of the materials are in the second column. e The third column of the table is for you to complete. Here write the names of some objects you have seen that are made from that material. Some objects around you may be made from materials not in this list, e.g., clay and rubber are missing in Khushi’s list. Use one of these to add an additional row in the table. Khushi’s list Name of the Objects made of this material material which are in your classroom or home Table, chair, door Wood For example, pencil Door hinges, nails, Metal Windowpanes, light | Glass bulb Electric switches Plastic Where do all these materials come from? Can you locate their source? For example, Wood — Tree Metals — Glass is mostly made of sand! 6/24/2024 3:02:38 PM This World of Things Talk to your Grandparents In their childhood, were these things made of the same materials? Are there new materials now that they might not have seen before? Are there any materials that they saw in their childhood that are not in use now? Why? Different materials may look different. Are they also different in other ways? Would you be able to recognise some material even with your eyes closed? ¢ What material is your spoon made of? e Is it made of metal, wood or some other material? Can you guess? ¢ Which of these words or phrases describes the spoon? Smooth Rough Dull Shiny Feels cold to the touch Ch 10 This world of things.indd 129 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Knock on it and it will speak to you! Orchestra Take a metal spoon and at least five objects made up of different materials— wood, metal, plastic, cloth and glass. Gently tap the spoon on each of them. Listen to the sound that each of them makes. Make your own words to describe all these different sounds. Try to capture those sounds in words, like ti dhum-dhum, dub-dub, ... Now compose your own beats. -ting, Does it Bend? S\\ Khushi’s table is made of wood. What else is used to make tables? Can we use fabric or rubber to make a table? Why or why not? Wood is hard and rigid while fabric is soft and flexible. The flexibility of fabric makes it more suitable to make clothes and curtains. Imagine if clothes were made of wood! Odd Pairs List five objects and pair them with a material that is not suitable for it! Explain why these materials will not work to make these objects. One example is done for you. 6/24/2024 3:02:40 PM This World of Things Objects Material Reasons 1. Umbrella Paper Paper will tear if it gets wet in the rain 2. 4. Does it Flow? In her ‘Odd Pairs’, Khushi playfully wrote, “Walls — can’t be made of water.” We don’t make walls of water because they will fall. What else could happen to water walls? We need ‘solid’ things such as stones, bricks or wood to make walls. Things that do not change their shape are called ‘solid’. Water does not keep its shape — it flows. Air flows too, but in a different way. If you pour water into a cup it stays there. Water is a liquid’. Air does not stay in a cup, it just floats in and out. That is because air is a gas. So objects can be classified as solids, liquids and gases. Ch 10 This world of things.indd 131 Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Let’s group them another way! Here are the names of some objects: ink, a stone, smoke, ice, steam, a spoon, honey, a bottle, a bag, water. If it is a solid, write its name on the tray; if itis a liquid, write its name in the bottle; if it is a gas, write its name in the balloon. BE8 Add some of your own objects in the tray, bottle and balloon. Some objects could be confusing, such as sand or a sponge or clay. Identify more such objects and write names of at least three of them. 6/24/2024 3:02:42 PM This World of Things Natural — Artificial Khushi drew a_ picture of a mango tree with a mango growing on it and a bird sitting on it. The tree, mango and bird are not made by humans but occur naturally in nature. Things that exist naturally are called ‘natural’. Natural things may be alive, like plants and animals, or not alive, like rocks, water and air. Things that are made by people are called ‘artificial’ like clothes, shoes, tables, etc. List out five things in each group. e Natural: e Artificial: In the next chapter we will further explore how things are made.

How do these activities create waste? Finally, what do we do with the waste? • Share your findings with your classmates. Note to the Teacher Remind children of some examples of common waste-producing activities, e.g., packaged products, take-away food, plastic and decorations. 150 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 150 6/24/2024 3:06:22 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 How is waste Created? our In everyday activities, we create a lot of waste. We dispose of old clothes, tins, bottles, paper, peels of vegetables and fruits, plastic wrappers, pencil shavings, old batteries and so many other things. We try to throw the waste away but sometimes we see that it ends up in garbage piles. These are the piles of waste that you see around your home, school or in the neighbourhood. How do you feel about it? Do you think we can do something about it? Managing waste We need to learn to manage waste. Managing waste is in our own hands. Each one of us has to learn to manage waste. We can learn from people and places that are managing their waste well. Let us see what they do and how they do it! 151 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 151 6/24/2024 3:06:25 PM Taking Charge of Waste ways to Manage waste Very often, you will find trash on the roadside, near houses and yards. Cows and other animals can die by eating plastic mixed with food. Some people burn plastic which releases harmful gases. falling People ill start because of all the garbage them. Puddles and around wastewater can be seen flowing through the roads. This leads to an increase in mosquitoes. This can cause diseases through their bites. The wastewater may carry germs that cause other diseases. But in some places, people have worked very hard to clean their houses and surroundings. We will learn how they do this in the following sections. 2 Observe your surroundings. • How clean are the surroundings of your school? • Do you find waste lying in or outside your classrooms or on the school grounds? 152 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 152 6/24/2024 3:06:27 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Draw or paste a picture of a locality. Identify the places where there is garbage or wastewater or smoke by circling them in red. Try to find out how the waste gets there. If you belong to a place that manages its waste well, ask the elders how it is done. Share your findings in the class. Now let us talk about those people who manage waste well. Reduce Many people avoid food and drinks packed in wrappers or plastic bottles and use cloth bags in place of plastic bags to reduce waste. Have you ever tried doing this? REDUCE the amount of waste you create is the first rule they follow. 3 How can you help in reducing waste? 153 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 153 6/24/2024 3:06:28 PM Taking Charge of Waste Be a part of the Cleanliness Drive by sharing your old toys and books with those who need them but cannot afford to buy them. In what other ways can you help? The more things we buy, the more things we throw away and the more waste gets created. We should try to buy things that we need and use them until they are not usable anymore. We can try to create as little waste as possible. Reuse The second thing many people do is that they REUSE things instead of throwing them away. Our grandparents did not throw away old clothes. They made quilts from old sarees and bags from old clothes. Sometimes, they also give old clothes to those who are in need of clothes. The use of newspapers or old cloth for gift wrapping is an eco-friendly practice that reduces waste and conserves resources. By creatively 154 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 154 6/24/2024 3:06:30 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 utilising these items, we not only reduce our waste but also add a personalised touch to our gifts. 4 How can you REUSE things to reduce waste? You can reuse paper that has been used on one side for rough work. Instead of buying water bottle, reuse a bottle made of a safe material like steel or copper by refilling it. You can make toys or decorative things using old newspapers, old calendars, bottles, boxes, etc . Here is one such idea. All you need is some newspaper. No scissors! No Glue! Just paper! Steps to make a paper bag Note to the Teacher You can make a number of things using newspapers and other waste material. Refer to http://arvindguptatoys.com/ for ideas. 155 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 155 6/24/2024 3:06:31 PM Taking Charge of Waste 5 Create an item using waste material that you can give as a gift to someone. Show your gratitude! You can give this to the person who helps to keep the locality or home clean. Tell them that you have made this so that you can reduce waste and their workload. Do not forget to say a big ‘Thank You’ to them. A Place of Pride Many of the villages and cities mentioned below had garbage littered all around them. But now they are perhaps the cleanest areas in the country. How did the people of these places change their surroundings? 156 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 156 6/24/2024 3:06:33 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Today, let’s take a tour of a village called Silluk in Arunachal Pradesh. As we enter the village, we notice clean roads. There is no trash lying on the roadsides or in corners or open spaces. The streets, lined with trees, feel as if we are walking in a garden! This village has received an award for managing its waste in the best possible way. It is called a ‘zero waste village’. Like Silluk there are many more villages in our country that are a model for waste management practices. Chhota Narena was one of the first villages to become waste-free. Several other towns and cities, such as Indore and Mysuru, stand out for being clean cities. • Ask your elders, if there is any village, town or city that they know about, which is known for its cleanliness. You can share the information you learn from your elders in your class. • Find out from your parents or teachers about the Swachh Bharat Mission. 157 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 157 6/24/2024 3:06:35 PM Taking Charge of Waste Separate Different types of waste If you look around, you will notice dustbins of two colours. These could be placed in your school, local market, park or at a bus stand, railway platform or at a mela. Why are these two kinds of dustbins used? Let us read on to learn what we put in these dustbins. The green dustbin is used for things like dried leaves or branches, fruit peels, vegetable waste or egg shells. These materials rot easily and mix with the soil. Waste in the green dustbin can be added to soil where it gets converted into compost food for plants and for tiny animals that live in the soil. The blue dustbin is used for things made of metal, glass, plastic and paper. New objects can be made like metal, glass, from materials plastic or paper that have been thrown away. This is called recycling. Some villages have bins for each of these materials separately so that it is easier to send them to different places for recycling. Villages and towns that 158 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 158 6/24/2024 3:06:38 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 separate and recycle their waste are able to keep their surroundings clean. They manage waste effectively. 6 Separate Your Waste Two dustbins are drawn below. Write the names of the waste material which will go into each of them. Plastic bottles, leaves, onion peels, light bulbs, rotten fruit, paper, eggshells, used plastic milk packets, cloth.

In our everyday activities, we create a lot of waste. We dispose of old clothes, tins, bottles, paper, peels of vegetables and fruits, plastic wrappers, pencil shavings, old batteries and so many other things. We try to throw the waste away but sometimes we see that it ends up in garbage piles. These are the piles of waste that you see around your home, school or in the neighbourhood. How do you feel about it? Do you think we can do something about it? Managing Waste We need to learn to manage waste. Managing waste is in our own hands. Each one of us has to learn to manage waste. We can learn from people and places that are managing their waste well. Let us see what they do and how they do it! 151 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 151 6/24/2024 3:06:25 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Ways to Manage Waste Very often, you will find trash on the roadside, near houses and yards. Cows and other animals can die by eating plastic mixed with food. Some people burn plastic which releases harmful gases. People start falling ill because of all the garbage around them. Puddles and wastewater can be seen flowing through the roads. This leads to an increase in mosquitoes. This can cause diseases through their bites. The wastewater may carry germs 1 that cause other diseases. But in some places, people have worked very hard to clean their houses and surroundings. We will learn how they do this in the following sections. Observe your surroundings. # DISCUSS “8 e How clean are the surroundings of your school? ¢ Doyou find waste lying in or outside your classrooms or on the school grounds? Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 152 6/24/2024 3:06:27 PM Taking Charge of Waste Draw or paste a picture of a locality. Identify the places where there is garbage or wastewater or smoke by circling them in red. Try to find out how the waste gets there. If you belong to a place that manages its waste well, ask the elders how it is done. Share your findings in the class. Now let us talk about those people who manage waste well. Reduce Many people avoid food and drinks packed in wrappers or plastic bottles and use cloth bags in place of plastic bags to reduce waste. Have you ever tried doing this? REDUCE the amount of waste you create is the first rule they follow. How can you help in reducing waste? 153 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 153 6/24/2024 3:06:28 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Be a part of the Cleanliness Drive by sharing your old toys and books with those who need them but cannot afford to buy them. In what other ways can you help? The more things we buy, the more things we throw away and the more waste gets created. We should try to buy things that we need and use them until they are not usable anymore. We can try to create as little waste Reuse The second thing many people do is that they REUSE things instead of throwing them away. Our grandparents did not throw away old clothes. They made quilts from old sarees and bags from old clothes. Sometimes, they also give old clothes to those who are in need of clothes. The use of newspapers or old cloth for gift wrapping is an eco-friendly practice that reduces waste and conserves resources. By creatively 2 fae Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 154 6/24/2024 3:06:30 PM Taking Charge of Waste utilising these items, we not only reduce our waste but also add a personalised touch to our gifts. How can you REUSE things to reduce waste? You can reuse paper that has been used on one side for rough work. Instead of buying water bottle, reuse a bottle made of a safe material like steel or copper by refilling it. You can make toys or decorative things using old newspapers, old calendars, bottles, boxes, etc . Here is one such idea. All you need is some newspaper. No scissors! No Glue! Just paper! Steps to make a paper bag Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 155 6/24/2024 3:06:31 PM Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Create an item using waste material that you can give as a gift to someone. Show your Gratitude! You can give this to the person who helps to keep the locality or home clean. Tell them that you have made this so that you can reduce waste and their workload. Do not forget to say a big ‘Thank You’ to them. A Place of Pride Many of the villages and cities mentioned below had garbage littered all around them. But now they are perhaps the cleanest areas in the country. How did the people of these places change their surroundings? Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 156 6/24/2024 3:06:33 PM Taking Charge of Waste Today, let’s take a tour of a village called Silluk in Arunachal Pradesh. As we enter the village, we notice clean roads. There is no trash lying on the roadsides or in corners or open spaces. The streets, lined with trees, feel as if we are walking in a garden! This village has received an award for managing its waste in the best possible way. It is called a ‘ero waste village’. Like Silluk there are many more villages in our country that are a model for waste management practices. Chhota Narena was one of the first villages to become waste-free. Several other towns and cities, such as Indore and Mysuru, stand out for being clean cities. 157 Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 157 6/24/2024 3:06:35 PM | Our Wondrous World | Class 3 Separate Different Types of Waste If you look around, you will notice dustbins of two colours. These could be placed in your school, local market, park or at a bus stand, railway platform or at a mela. Why are these two kinds of dustbins used? Let us read on to learn what we put in these dustbins. The green dustbin is used for things like dried leaves or branches, fruit peels, vegetable waste or egg shells. These materials rot easily and mix with the soil. Waste in the green dustbin can be added to soil where it gets converted into compost food for plants and for tiny animals that live in the soil. The blue dustbin is used for things made of metal, glass, plastic and paper. New objects can be made from materials like metal, glass, plastic or paper that have been thrown away. This is called recycling. Some villages have bins for each of these materials separately so that it is easier to send them to different places for recycling. Villages and towns that Ch 12 Taking charge of waste.indd 158 6/24/2024 3:06:38 PM Taking Charge of Waste separate and recycle their waste are able to keep their surroundings clean. They manage waste effectively. Separate Your Waste Two dustbins are drawn below. Write the names of the waste material which will go into each of them. Each one of us can help to keep our home, neighbourhood, school, city and country clean.

It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle stages, spanning three years from Class 3 to Class 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way and discovery, plus the activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social sciences. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), brought out, as a follow- up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called ‘The World Around Us’ at the Preparatory Stage. This subject aims to provide environmental education through an experiential learning approach, connecting children’s experiences with the basic concepts of different subject areas which they will study at the Middle Stage. Our Wondrous World, the textbook for The World Around Us, has been designed to help children connect their day-to-day learning about their world to the basic concepts of various subject areas— science, social sciences and environmental education. It aims to enhance their sensitivity towards their environment, develop skills to work with the community, and foster a positive attitude towards various professions. Prelims.indd 3 6/25/2024 12:15:30 PM Our Wondrous World emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and the values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness, integrating appropriate ICT tools and school-based assessments. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage needs to be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children also need to explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates children, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder, vital for learning. I recommend this textbook with confidence to all children and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet the expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content. New Delhi 25 May 2024 Dinesh PrasaD saklani Director National Council of Educational Research and Training iv Prelims.indd 4 6/25/2024 12:15:31 PM About the Textbook for School Education The National Curriculum Framework (NCF-SE) 2023 has identified The World Around Us (TWAU) as a core curricular area at the Preparatory Stage of School Education for Classes 3–5. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023 emphasise the need for integrating a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to learning in this subject area. Thus, the nature of this subject area has been recommended as integrated and interdisciplinary. Both the above policy documents advocate experiential learning, exploration and discovery as an essential component of the Preparatory Stage curriculum. Based on the above policy perspective, a textbook titled Our Wondrous World for Class 3 has been designed and developed. Our Wondrous World, as the title suggests, evokes curiosity and promotes experiential learning, exploration, investigation, discovery, and critical thinking through hands-on activities and open-ended inquiries. This subject integrates science, social sciences and environmental education. The book emphasises real life experiences to deepen understanding and foster problem solving and critical thinking skills as children explore their surroundings with joy and curiosity. The design of the chapters for each unit provides opportunities for the young minds to think independently, reflect on their observations and answer open-ended questions. This provides opportunities to children to do away with rote memorisation and encourages children to actively engage with their surroundings, fostering a sense of curiosity and inquiry. This approach follows a progression from known to unknown, local to global, simple to complex, concrete to abstract and familiar to unfamiliar in the development of concepts and skills. This textbook has three broad components. The first component is the selection of content and skills for expected learning. The second component is the presentation of content in a manner that is interactive for children. It assists teachers in transacting concepts and skills. The presentation of the text includes various age-appropriate pedagogical approaches such as play-based, theme- based, toy-based and inquiry-based to make the transactional processes child-centric and enjoyable. Prelims.indd 5 6/25/2024 12:15:32 PM The third component is the selection of assessment processes and tracking the progress of children’s learning. We all know that children also learn through picture reading, discussion, experimentation, solving puzzles and riddles, sharing experiences, and expressing thoughts and ideas through drawing and writing. To lighten the burden of assessment, instructions have been given to assess learning through such activities. For effective and meaningful assessment, class-wise learning outcomes and competencies have been identified in each subject, and teachers should assess learning accordingly. All the three components related to the approach of this textbook can be understood by this example — in the chapter ‘Food We Eat’, children learn about traditional cuisines like haakh (a kind of green saag which is popular in Srinagar). This instance arouses curiosity about the variety of foods in their own region and the different regions of our country. This exploration integrates various subjects as we try to understand the ingredients used to cook the particular food item, learn about the regions where these foods originated from and their cultural practices. Children examine how food reflects cultural practices across India. Such an interdisciplinary approach deepens children’s understanding, and helps them make rich connections across subjects, themes, and concepts. Our Wondrous World is structured in four units concerning themes involving the world around children. The structure of each unit follows a coherent format designed to engage children effectively. Each chapter of the units feature an interactive-cum-dialogue or story-cum-narrative approach to the concepts and skills being taught. For instance, in Unit 2, the theme ‘Getting to Know Plants’ presents an interactive dialogue between children who are exploring a garden and discovering different types of plants, parts of a plant, and the need to take care of the plants for balanced and harmonious living. The presentation of the content in each chapter is child friendly, and encourages active participation of the children in the learning process. The self-explanatory illustrations aim in developing observation and critical-thinking skills of the children. An effort has been made that the level of language and concepts in the book are age-appropriate and relate to different regions of our country. vi Prelims.indd 6 6/25/2024 12:15:32 PM At the beginning of each unit, a concept scheme for each chapter is given that will help to target the desired competencies and expected learning outcomes. The language used in the book is simple and clear, ensuring that children can easily grasp the concepts given in all the four units. However, the book also incorporates some new vocabulary to offer a gentle challenge and expand children’s language skills, e.g., by introducing terms like ‘transparent’, ‘opaque’ and ‘translucent’ within the context of learning about materials and their properties. It has been explained through illustrations and descriptions to help children understand these words in relation to real-world objects. Furthermore, each chapter has an inbuilt assessment idea that helps in tracking the progress of children and tailoring learning- teaching strategies accordingly. These assessment ideas include activities like drawing a sketch from home to school, creating a rangoli using materials from nature, discussion points, matching traffic signs, labelling certain pictures, conducting simple experiments to observe plant growth, or answering open-ended questions about the functions of different parts of a plant. ‘Let us reflect’ is a section in which children get an opportunity to summarise the learning from the chapter. The activities given in the book are suggestive in nature. Teachers are free to create additional activities besides what is given in the book, without putting any kind of pressure on the children, and see that they connect the children with their local environment. Through Our Wondrous World, we have endeavoured to offer our children dynamic and engaging learning experiences. We hope that this book will open doors to understanding the wonders of nature and lead to better learning-teaching of this important interdisciplinary subject. vii Prelims.indd 7 6/25/2024 12:15:32 PM Prelims.indd 8 6/25/2024 12:15:32 PM National Syllabus and Teaching Learning Material Committee (NSTC) 1.

It enables them not only to imbibe the invaluable samskaras rooted in our country’s ethos and constitutional framework, but also to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. This foundation equips them to transition seamlessly into the more challenging Preparatory Stage. The Preparatory Stage acts as a bridge between the Foundational and the Middle stages, spanning three years from Class 3 to Class 5. The education provided during this stage builds upon the pedagogical approaches of the Foundational Stage. While the play-way and discovery, plus the activity-based learning methods continue, children are also introduced to textbooks and formal classroom settings. This introduction aims not to overwhelm but to establish a foundation across curricular areas, promoting holistic learning and self-exploration through reading, writing, speaking, drawing, singing, and playing. This comprehensive approach encompasses physical education, art education, environmental education, languages, mathematics, basic science, and social sciences. This comprehensive approach ensures children are well-prepared both at the cognitive-sensitive and physical-pranic (emotional) levels to effortlessly transition to the Middle Stage. Adhering to the recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), brought out, as a follow- up to the NEP 2020, a new subject area called The World Around Us’ at the Preparatory Stage. This subject aims to provide environmental education through an experiential learning approach, connecting children’s experiences with the basic concepts of different subject areas which they will study at the Middle Stage. Our Wondrous World, the textbook for The World Around Us, has been designed to help children connect their day-to-day learning about their world to the basic concepts of various subject areas—science, social sciences and environmental education. It aims to enhance their sensitivity towards their environment, develop skills to work with the community, and foster a positive attitude towards various professions. Our Wondrous World emphasises conceptual understanding, critical thinking, creativity, and the values and dispositions essential for this developmental stage. It incorporates cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, multilingualism, gender equality, and cultural rootedness, integrating appropriate ICT tools and school-based assessments. Children’s innate curiosity at this stage needs to be nurtured by addressing their questions and designing activities based on core learning principles. While the play-way method continues, the nature of toys and games used for teaching evolves to enhance engagement rather than mere attraction. While this textbook is valuable, children also need to explore additional resources on the subject. School libraries should facilitate this extended learning, and parents and teachers should support their endeavours. An effective learning environment motivates children, keeping them engaged and fostering curiosity and wonder, vital for learning. I recommend this textbook with confidence to all children and teachers at the Preparatory Stage. I extend my gratitude to everyone involved in its development, hopeful that it will meet the expectations. As NCERT remains committed to systemic reforms and improving publication quality, we welcome feedback to refine the textbook content. DINESH PRASAD SAKLANI Director New Delhi National Council of Educational 25 May 2024 Research and Training 6/25/2024 12:15:31 PM Prelims.indd 5 About the Textbook The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 has identified The World Around Us (TWAU) as a core curricular area at the Preparatory Stage of School Education for Classes 3-5. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023 emphasise the need for integrating a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to learning in this subject area. Thus, the nature of this subject area has been recommended as integrated and interdisciplinary. Both the above policy documents advocate experiential learning, exploration and discovery as an essential component of the Preparatory Stage curriculum. Based on the above policy perspective, a textbook titled Our Wondrous World for Class 3 has been designed and developed. Our Wondrous World, as the title suggests, evokes curiosity and promotes experiential learning, exploration, investigation, discovery, and critical thinking through hands-on activities and open-ended inquiries. This subject integrates science, social sciences and environmental education. The book emphasises real life experiences to deepen understanding and foster problem solving and critical thinking skills as children explore their surroundings with joy and curiosity. The design of the chapters for each unit provides opportunities for the young minds to think independently, reflect on their observations and answer open-ended questions. This provides opportunities to children to do away with rote memorisation and encourages children to actively engage with their surroundings, fostering a sense of curiosity and inquiry. This approach follows a progression from known to unknown, local to global, simple to complex, concrete to abstract and familiar to unfamiliar in the development of concepts and skills. This textbook has three broad components. The first component is the selection of content and skills for expected learning. The second component is the presentation of content in a manner that is interactive for children. It assists teachers in transacting concepts and skills. The presentation of the text includes various age-appropriate pedagogical approaches such as play-based, theme- based, toy-based and inquiry-based to make the transactional processes child-centric and enjoyable. The third component is the selection of assessment processes and tracking the progress of children’s learning. We all know that children also learn through picture reading, discussion, experimentation, solving puzzles and riddles, sharing experiences, and expressing thoughts and ideas through drawing and writing. To lighten the burden of assessment, instructions have been given to assess learning through such activities. For effective and meaningful assessment, class-wise learning outcomes and competencies have been identified in each subject, and teachers should assess learning accordingly. All the three components related to the approach of this textbook can be understood by this example—in the chapter ‘Food We Eat’, children learn about traditional cuisines like haakh (a kind of green saag which is popular in Srinagar). This instance arouses curiosity about the variety of foods in their own region and the different regions of our country. This exploration integrates various subjects as we try to understand the ingredients used to cook the particular food item, learn about the regions where these foods originated from and their cultural practices. Children examine how food reflects cultural practices across India. Such an interdisciplinary approach deepens children’s understanding, and helps them make rich connections across subjects, themes, and concepts. Our Wondrous World is structured in four units concerning themes involving the world around children. The structure of each unit follows a coherent format designed to engage children effectively. Each chapter of the units feature an interactive-cum-dialogue or story-cum-narrative approach to the concepts and skills being taught. For instance, in Unit 2, the theme ‘Getting to Know Plants’ presents an interactive dialogue between children who are exploring a garden and discovering different types of plants, parts of a plant, and the need to take care of the plants for balanced and harmonious living. The presentation of the content in each chapter is child friendly, and encourages active participation of the children in the learning process. The self-explanatory illustrations aim in developing observation and critical-thinking skills of the children. An effort has been made that the level of language and concepts in the book are age-appropriate and relate to different regions of our country. 6/25/2024 12:15:32 PM Prelims.indd 7 At the beginning of each unit, a concept scheme for each chapter is given that will help to target the desired competencies and expected learning outcomes. The language used in the book is simple and clear, ensuring that children can easily grasp the concepts given in all the four units. However, the book also incorporates some new vocabulary to offer a gentle challenge and expand children’s language skills, e.g., by introducing terms like ‘transparent’, ‘opaque’ and ‘translucent’ within the context of learning about materials and their properties. It has been explained through illustrations and descriptions to help children understand these words in relation to real-world objects. Furthermore, each chapter has an inbuilt assessment idea that helps in tracking the progress of children and tailoring learning- teaching strategies accordingly. These assessment ideas include activities like drawing a sketch from home to school, creating a rangoli using materials from nature, discussion points, matching traffic signs, labelling certain pictures, conducting simple experiments to observe plant growth, or answering open-ended questions about the functions of different parts of a plant. ‘Let us reflect’ is a section in which children get an opportunity to summarise the learning from the chapter. The activities given in the book are suggestive in nature. Teachers are free to create additional activities besides what is given in the book, without putting any kind of pressure on the children, and see that they connect the children with their local environment. Through Our Wondrous World, we have endeavoured to offer our children dynamic and engaging learning experiences. We hope that this book will open doors to understanding the wonders of nature and lead to better learning-teaching of this important interdisciplinary subject.
