            "Jai:I would like to know first how Lord Krishna and Arjuna happened to talk on the battlefield, Grandma.",
            "Grandma:It came about in this way, Jai. The war of Mahabharata was about to begin after peace talks by Lord Krishna and others failed to avoid the war. When the soldiers were gathered on the battlefield, Arjuna asked Lord Krishna to drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see those who were ready to fight. Seeing all his relatives, friends, and soldiers on the battlefield and fearing their destruction, he became compassionate.",
            "Jai:What does compassionate mean, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:Compassion does not mean pity, Jai. That would be looking down on others as poor, pitiful creatures. Arjuna was feeling their pain and their unlucky situation as his own. Arjuna was a great warrior, who had fought many wars and was well prepared for the war, but suddenly his compassion made him not want to fight. He spoke of the evils of war and sat down on the seat of his chariot, his mind full of sorrow. He saw no use in fighting. He did not know what to do.",
            "Jai:I dont blame him. I wouldnt want to fight either. Why do people fight, Grandma? Why are there wars?",
            "Grandma:Jai, there are not only wars between nations, but quarrels between two people, quarrels between brothers and sisters, between husband and wife, between friends and neighbors. The main reason is that people are not able to let go of their selfish motives and desires.Most wars are fought for possession and power. But all problems could be solved peacefully if people could see both sides of the problem and work out an agreement. War should be the last resort. Our holy books say: One should not commit violence towards anyone. Unjustified killing is punishable in all circumstances. Lord Krishna urged Arjuna to fight for his rights, but not to kill needlessly. It was his duty as a warrior to fight a declared war and establish peace and law and order on earth.",
            "We humans also have wars going inside all of us. Our negative and positive forces are always fighting. The negative forces within us are represented by the Kauravas and the positive forces by the Pandavas.The Gita does not have stories in it to illustrate the teachings, so I will add some stories from other sources to help you.",
            "Here is a story about negative and positive thoughts fighting each other that Lord Krishna Himself told to Arjuna in Mahabharata.",
            "1. Mr. TruthfulThere once lived a great hermit, who was famous for telling the truth. He had taken a vow not to lie and was popularly known as Mr. Truthful. No matter what he said, everyone believed him because he had earned a great reputation in the community where he lived and did his spiritual practices.",
            "One evening, a robber was chasing a merchant to rob and kill him. The merchant was running for his life. To escape from the robber, the merchant ran towards the forest where the hermit lived outside the village.",
            "The merchant felt very safe because there was no way the robber could find out where he was hiding in the jungle. But the hermit had seen the direction in which the merchant went.",
            "The robber came to the hermits cottage and paid his respects. The robber knew that the hermit would tell only the truth and could be trusted, so he asked him whether he had seen somebody running away. The hermit knew that the robber must be looking for somebody to rob and kill, so he faced a big problem. If he told the truth, the merchant would certainly be killed. If he lied, he would incur the sin of lying and lose his reputation. Any immoral act that may harm others is called sin. Ahimsa (nonviolence) and truthfulness are two most important teachings of all religions that we must follow. If we have to choose between these two, which one should we choose? This is a very difficult choice.",
            "Because of his habit of telling the truth, the hermit said: Yes, I saw someone going that way. So the robber was able to find the merchant and kill him. The hermit could have saved a life by hiding the truth, but he did not think very carefully and made a wrong decision.",
            "Lord Krishnas purpose in telling Arjuna this story was to teach Arjuna that sometimes we have to choose between a rock and a hard place.Lord Krishna told Arjuna that the hermit shared with the robber the sin of killing a life. The robber could not have found the merchant if the hermit had not told the truth. So when two noble principles conflict with each other, we have to know which one is the higher principle. Ahimsa has the highest priority, so the hermit should have lied in this situation to save a life. One may not tell a truth that harms a person in any way. It isnt easy to apply Dharma (or righteousness) to real life situations because what is Dharma and what is Adharma (or unrighteousness) can sometimes be very difficult to decide. In such a situation, expert advice should be sought.",
            "Lord Krishna gave another example of a robber coming to a village to rob and kill the villagers. In this situation, killing the robber would be an act of nonviolence because killing one person may save many lives. Lord Krishna Himself, on several occasions, had to make such decisions to win the war of Mahabharata and put an end to all the evil-doers.",
            "Remember, Jai, do not tell a lie, and do not kill any living being or hurt anybody, but saving a life comes first."

Arjuna felt great compassion to see his friends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win the war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and refused to fight.",

            "Jai:If Arjuna felt so kind-hearted for everyone he was supposed to kill in the war, how could he go out and fight, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:That is exactly what Arjuna asked Lord Krishna. He said: How shall I strike my grandfather, my guru, and all other relatives with arrows in battle? They are worthy of my respect. (Gita 2.04)",
            "Arjuna had a good point. In Vedic culture, gurus, the elderly, honorable persons, and all other superiors are to be respected. But the scriptures also say that anyone who acts wrongly or unlawfully against you or others, or anyone who supports such deeds, should no longer be respected, but punished.",
            "Arjuna was confused about his duty and asked guidance from Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna then instructed him on the true knowledge of Atma and the physical body.",
            "Jai:What is Atma, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:Atma is also called the Spirit, or the soul. Atma is never born, never dies, and is everlasting.Our body takes birth and dies, but not Atma. Atma supports the body. Without Atma, the body becomes dead. Atma supplies the power to our body, mind, and senses, just as air burns and supports fire. Weapons cannot cut Atma, fire cannot burn it, wind cannot dry it, and water cannot make it wet. Therefore, we should not grieve over death of the body because the Atma inside the body never dies. (Gita 2.23-24)",
            "Jai:What is the difference between Atma (Spirit), soul, and body Grandma?",
            "Grandma:One and the same Atma dwells inside all bodies. Our body changes with time. Our old-age body is different from our childhood body. But Atma does not change. Atma takes a childhood body, a youth body, and an old-age body during this life, then takes another body after death. (Gita 2.13) The Sanskrit word Atma is translated as Spirit in English. Spirit is universal and all pervading. The English word spirit or soul also means the Spirit residing in individual bodies. In Sanskrit language, we call this individual soul Jivatma or Jiva (also spelled as Jeeva). If Spirit is compared to a forest, the individual soul (spirit or Jiva) can be compared to the tree in the forest.",
            "The body is called a garment of Atma. Just as we get rid of an old, worn-out garment and put on a new one, similarly, Atma gets rid of the old body and takes a new one after death. So death is like changing the garment of Atma. (Gita 2.22) All beings are visible between birth and death; they cant be seen before birth or after death and remain in their invisible form. (Gita 2.28) Therefore, we should not grieve over death of the body. We are not the body. We are Atma with a body. Death just means our soul passes from one body to another new body.",
            "Jai:Then why did Arjuna grieve over deaths of loved ones on the battlefield? Why didnt he want to fight?",
            "Grandma:Arjuna was a very tough warrior, Jai, but he wanted to run away from the horrors of war and lead an easy life of a Samnyasi, a wandering hermit. Lord Krishna taught us to face the battle of life by giving Arjuna the beautiful science of KarmaYoga, the art of peaceful and prosperous living. Chapter 3 of the Gita tells us more about this. Arjuna was worried about the results of the war, but Lord Krishna asks us to do our duty without worrying too much about the results, such as gain and loss, victory and defeat, success and failure. If you are constantly worried about the results of your studies, you will not be able to put your heart and soul into them for fear of failure.",
            "Jai:But Grandma, how could Arjuna fight his best if he wasnt fighting to win and gain something?",
            "Grandma:Arjuna must fight to win, but he should not weaken his will by worrying about the result while he is fighting. He should put all his attention and energy into every minute of the fight. That energy is what will bring the greatest result.",
            "Lord Krishna tells us that we have full control over our action, but no control over the results of our action. (Gita 2.47) Harry Bhalla says: A farmer has control over how he works his land, yet no control over the harvest. But he cannot expect a harvest if he does not work his land with best effort and with tools he has.",
            "We should do our best at the present moment and let the future take care of itself.",
            "Jai:Could you tell me more about the secret of success as told by Krishna to Arjuna?",
            "Grandma:We should be so completely absorbed in work or study as to become unaware of everything else, even of its results. To achieve the best results from what we do, we should be focused on the action with undivided attention.",
            "Action should be done sincerely without worrying about its results.The results of the action will be greater if we put all attention and energy into the action itself and do not allow our energy to be diverted by thinking of results. The result will depend on energy put into action. We are asked not to worry about results during the course of action. This does not mean that we should not care about results. But we should not expect only positive results all the time.",
            "Jai:What is a Self-realized person like, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:A Self-realized person is a perfect person, Jai. Lord Krishna tells us the mind of a perfect person is not shaken by difficulties, does not run after pleasures, is free from fear, desire, greed, and attachment, and has control over mind and senses. (Gita 2.56) A Self-realized person does not get angry, is peaceful and happy.",
            "Jai:How can we keep from getting angry, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:We get angry if our desire is not fulfilled. (Gita 2.62) So the best way to control anger is to control or limit our desires. We should not want too many things. Desires begin in the mind, so we should control our mind. If we dont control our mind, we drift like a ship without its rudder. The desire for pleasure takes one to the dark alley of sin, gets us in trouble, and prevents our progress. (Gita 2.67) As a student, you should set a higher goal for yourself than pleasure. Put forth your best effort and concentrate on your studies.",
            "Arjuna was a very good example of such concentration. Here is a story about him.",
            "2. The Graduation TestGuru Drona was the military teacher for both the Kauravas and the Pandavas. At the end of their military training came final examination time. Drona put a wooden eagle on the branch of a nearby tree. Nobody knew it was just a doll. It looked like a real eagle. To pass the graduation test, every one of the students was supposed to cut off the eagles head with one arrow.Guru Drona first asked Yudhisthira, the eldest of the Pandavas: Get ready, look at the eagle, and tell me what you are seeing.",
            "Yudhisthira replied: I see the sky, the clouds, the tree trunk, the branches, the leaves and the eagle sitting there\"",
            "Guru Drona was not very pleased with this answer. He asked the same of all the students, one by one. Every one of them gave a similar answer. Then came Arjunas turn for the test.",
            "Drona asked Arjuna: Get ready, look at the eagle, and tell me what you are seeing.",
            "Arjuna replied: I only see the eagle and nothing else",
            "Drona then asked a second question: If you are seeing the eagle, then tell me how strong is its body and what is the color of its wings?",
            "Arjuna replied: I am only seeing its head and not the entire body.",
            "Guru Drona was much pleased with Arjunas answer and asked him to go ahead with the test. Arjuna easily cut off the head of the eagle with one arrow because he was concentrating on his aim with a single mind. He passed the test with flying colors.",
            "Arjuna was not only the greatest warrior of his time, but also a compassionate KarmaYogi. Lord Krishna chose Arjuna as a medium to impart the knowledge of the holy Gita.",
            "We all should follow the example of Arjuna. Read the Gita and be like Arjuna. Arjuna Bano, Arjuna Bano, my dear grandson! Whatever work you do, do it with single-minded attention and put your whole heart and mind into it. This is the main theme of KarmaYoga of the Gita and the secret of success in anything you do.",
            "A word for the youth from Swami Vivekananda:",
            "\"Whatever you are doing, put your whole mind on it. If you are shooting, your mind should be only on the target. Then you will never miss. If you are learning your lessons, think only of the lesson. In India boys and girls are taught to do this\"."

We should do our duty to the best of our ability without worrying about success or failure. We must learn from our failures and go forward without letting our failures defeat us.

            "Jai:The Gita reports what was spoken on the battlefield, but who wrote it, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:The teachings of the Gita are very old. They were first given to the Sun-god in the beginning of creation by Lord Krishna. Over time, this knowledge got lost.The Gita in its present form is the teaching by the Supreme Lord, Krishna, to Arjuna about 5,100 years ago.",
            "Jai:So is Lord Krishna the author of the Gita?",
            "Grandma:Yes, Lord Krishna is the author of the Gita.It was put together by sage Vayasa who also edited the four Vedas. Sage Vayasa had the power of recalling events of the past and future, but he could not do the work of both recalling the Gita spoken by Krishna on the battlefield as well as writing it down. He needed a helper to write the Gita. Lord Ganesha, the lord of wisdom, offered to do the work of writing.",
            "Jai:Why is Lord Krishna so important?",
            "Grandma:Lord Krishna is considered the eighth incarnation of the Supreme God.The Supreme God comes to earth in different forms from time to time whenever the forces of evil try to disturb and destroy the world peace. Lord comes to set everything right. He also sends prophets and teachers to help mankind. His birth and activities are divine and each incarnation (Avataras) has a purpose. The Shrimad Bhagavatam (or the Bhagavad-Purana) gives details of all ten major Avataras of God. Lord Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Mohammad and saints and sages of other religions are also considered minor incarnations of God. At the end of the present time period, known as KaliYuga, the Kalki incarnation will happen in the very distant future.",
            "Jai:Will Lord Krishna give us whatever we want in prayer or worship?",
            "Grandma:Yes, Lord Krishna will give what you want (Gita 4.11), such as success in your study, if you worship Him with faith. People may worship and pray to God by using any name and form of God. The form of God is called deity. One can also worship God without the help of a deity.",
            "Jai:Will we still have to study if we want to do well in examinations?",
            "Grandma:Yes, you must do the work. Do your best and then pray. The good Lord will not work for you. You will have to do your own work. Your work should be free from selfish desires, and you should not hurt anybody. Then you will not earn any Karma.",
            "Jai:What is Karma, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:The Sanskrit word Karma means action. It also means the results of an action. The word Karma is most commonly mispronounced as Karma. Every action produces a result called Karma, which can be good or bad. If we do our work only to enjoy the results ourselves, we become responsible for the results. If our action harms anyone, we get bad Karma, called sin, and we will have to suffer in hell for it. If we do good to others, we earn good Karma and get rewarded by a trip to heaven.",
            "Our own Karma is responsible for our rebirth to enjoy or suffer the results of our deeds. Karma is like depositing money in the form of good and bad action in the bank. We do not take birth when all our Karma is used up. This freedom from the cycles of birth and death is called liberation, Nirvana, Moksha or Mukti. In Mukti one becomes one with God.",
            "Jai:How can we avoid Karma when we live and work in society?",
            "Grandma:The best way not to earn any Karma is not to do anything just for yourself, but do it for the good of society. Always keep in mind that Mother Nature does everything; we are not the real doer of any action. If we strongly believe this and work as a servant of God, we will not earn any new Karma, and all our past Karma will be wiped out by Self-knowledge. When all Karma is finished, we become liberated. This method of uniting with God is called the path of selfless action (KarmaYoga).",
            "Jai:How do we get rid of the Karma from our past lives?",
            "Grandma:A very good question! True knowledge of the Self (or God) acts like fire that burns away all Karma from our past lives. (Gita 4.37) Selfless service (KarmaYoga) prepares one to receive Self-knowledge. A KarmaYogi automatically gets Self-knowledge in due course of time. (Gita 4.38) One who has true knowledge of the Self or God is called a Self-realized or a God-realized person.",
            "Jai:Are there other ways to get liberation, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:Yes, Jai, there are different methods or ways to reach God. These methods are called spiritual practices or Sadhana. Any action that is beneficial to society is also called Yajna, Seva or sacrifice. Different types of Yajna are: (1) giving money as charity for a good cause, (2) doing meditation, worship and yogic exercises, (3) reading the scriptures to gain knowledge of God, and (4) having control over the mind and other five senses. (Gita 4.28)",
            "Lord is pleased by those who sincerely perform any one of these Yajna and gives them the gift of Self-knowledge to reach God. Such a person becomes happy and peaceful. (Gita 4.39)",
            "Jai:How about those who just worship a deity everyday? Can they also reach God?",
            "Grandma:Yes, those who worship the deity with full faith also get whatever they want. (Gita 4.11-12) Most Hindus worship God in the form of a chosen deity to fulfill their desires. This path is known as path of worship and prayer. There is a story in the Mahabharata of a devoted KarmaYogi and an ideal student who worshipped his guru and got what he wanted.",
            "4. Ekalavya, the Ideal StudentGuru Dronacharya (or Drona) was the military teacher (guru) appointed by grandfather Bhishma for all the Kaurava and Pandava brothers.Many other princes also took military training under him. Drona was very much pleased by Arjunas personal service and devotion to him, and he promised him: I will train you to be the best archer in the world.",
            "One day a very gentle boy named Ekalavya from a nearby village came to Drona and wanted to learn archery from him. He had heard from his mother about master archer Dronacharya, who was the son of the sage Bharadwaja and a disciple of sage Parashurama.",
            "Ekalavya was a jungle boy, belonging to the hunters' community.Then, and even today, such communities were considered socially inferior. Drona was worried how he could teach a jungle boy along with the royal children. So he decided not to keep the boy with him there, and told him: Son, it will be very difficult for me to teach you. But you are a born archer. Go back to the forest and practice well with deep interest. You too are my disciple. May you master archery as you wish!",
            "Drona's words were a great blessing to Ekalavya.He understood his helplessness and felt confident that the Masters good wishes were with him. He made a clay idol of Dronacharya, installed it in a nice place, and began to worship it respectfully by offering flowers, fruits, etc. He worshipped this idol of his guru everyday, practiced the lessons in archery in the Master's absence, and mastered the art.",
            "Ekalavya would get up early in the morning, bathe himself and offer worship to the masters idol. He cherished the words, actions, and training methods of Drona that he had seen at guru Dronas Ashram. He faithfully followed the instructions and continued his practice.",
            "While Arjuna had personally mastered archery from Drona, learning from him firsthand, Ekalavya achieved equally impressive skill while worshiping the Master from far away. If he could not do a particular technique, he would rush to Drona's image, present his problem, and wait in meditation until a solution appeared in his mind. He would then proceed further.",
            "The story of Ekalavya demonstrates that one can achieve anything in life if one has faith and works sincerely to reach the goal.The story continues:",
            "The Kaurava and Pandava princes once went to the forest on a hunting trip. Their leading dog was running forward. Ekalavya, a dark-skinned young man dressed in a tiger skin and wearing strings of conch-beads, was engaged in his practice. The dog, on approaching him, began to bark. Probably wishing to show off his skill, Ekalavya sent down a series of seven arrows in the direction of the barking dog, and his arrows filled its mouth. The dog ran back to the princes, who were surprised at this skill in archery and wondered who the archer was.",
            "Arjuna, seeing this, was not only surprised but also worried. He wanted to be known as the world's best archer.",
            "The princes went in search of the archer who had hit their dog with so many arrows in such a short time, and found Ekalavya.",
            "Arjuna said: Your skill in archery is great. Who is your guru?",
            "My guru is Dronacharya, replied Ekalavya humbly.",
            "Arjuna was shocked at the mention of Drona's name. Was this true? Could his dear teacher teach so much to this boy? If so, what about the Master's promise to him? When did Drona teach the boy? Arjuna had never seen Ekalavya before in his class.",
            "When Drona heard this story, he remembered Ekalavya and went to see him.",
            "Drona said: Your learning has been very good, son. I am deeply satisfied. With devotion and practice, you have done very well. May your achievement become an example for all to follow.",
            "Ekalavya was very happy and said: Thank you, oh Gurudeva! I too am a disciple of yours. Otherwise, I do not know whether I could have done this much.",
            "Drona said: If you accept me as your Master, you must pay my fee after your training. Think it over.",
            "Ekalavya smilingly replied: What is there to think over, Sir? I am your disciple, and you are my guru. Please say what you wish, Sir. I will fulfill it even if I have to sacrifice my life in the effort.",
            "Ekalavya, I have to demand a supreme sacrifice from you to fulfill my word to Bhishma and Arjuna that nobody would ever equal Arjuna in archery. Pardon me, son! Can you give me the thumb of your right hand as my fee?",
            "Ekalavya stared at Dronacharya for a while. He could understand the Master's problem. He then stood up, walked to the Dronas idol with determination, placed his right thumb upon a stone, and cut it off in an instant, using his left hand and an arrow.",
            "Drona, while feeling sorry for the injury he had caused Ekalavya, was at the same time deeply touched by such great devotion.He hugged him saying: Son, your love for guru is unmatched. I feel a sense of fulfillment in having had a disciple like you. May God bless you!",
            "Ekalavya got victory in defeat! With the right thumb gone, he could no longer use the bow effectively. But he continued his practice using his left arm. By virtue of his supreme sacrifice, he received the grace of God and achieved distinction as a left-handed archer. He proved that nothing could stop a totally sincere effort. By his actions and behavior, Ekalavya, showed that your inferior or superior status is not determined by the community you belong to but by your vision and qualities of mind and heart.",
            "Drona was a great guru, Jai. But there are many false gurus in the world who will try to cheat you.",
            "Jai:Do we need a guru to reach God?",
            "Grandma:We definitely need a teacher to learn any subject, spiritual or material. But to find a real guru is not so easy. There are four types of gurus: the knower of a subject or a teacher (guru), a false guru, a SadGuru and a ParamaGuru. There are many false gurus who just pose as a guru. SadGuru is a God-realized master and is very hard to find. Lord Krishna is called the JagadGuru or ParamaGuru, the world-teacher.",

Thus selfless service or KarmaYoga forms the basis of renunciation (Samnyasa). Both paths finally lead to God. Lord Krishna considers KarmaYoga the better of the two paths because it is faster and easier for most people to follow. (Gita 5.02)",
            "Jai:Doesnt the word renunciation usually mean leaving worldly possessions and living in an Ashram (monastery) or in a lonely place?",
            "Grandma:The word Samnyasa in the strict sense means renouncing (or giving up) all personal motives, worldly possessions and objects. But it also means living in society and serving society by doing ones duty without any personal motive. Such a person is called Karma-Samnyasi.",

Such a person looks at a learned person, an illiterate person, the rich, the poor, an outcast, even a cow, an elephant, or a dog with an equal eye. (Gita 5.18)",

He was born in the state of Kerala in the year 788 A.D. By the age of eight, he had learned all four Vedas, and by the age of twelve, was well versed in all Hindu scriptures. He is believed to be Lord Shiva in human form.",

He stopped the spread of Buddhism over Hindu ideals, and restored Hinduism to its past glory. According to his non-dual philosophy, the individual soul (Jiva) is Brahma (God), and the world is the play of Maya, the illusory kinetic energy of Brahma.",

            "Grandma:There is a creator behind any creation, Jai. Nothing can be created without somebody or some power behind it. Some power is needed, not only to create it, but also to support and run it. We call that power God, the Absolute, the Supreme in English, and Krishna, Ishvara, Bhagavan, Shiva in Sanskrit. Other religions call that power Allah, Father, Jehova, Devi and many other names. In a real sense, God is not the creator of the universe, but He Himself becomes everything in the universe. He manifests as Brahma, whom we call the creator. Actually, Brahma and all other deities (gods and goddesses) are just names of different powers of the one and only One God. People think Hindus worship many gods and goddesses, but that is due to lack of true knowledge. The entire universe is a manifestation of God. This is the highest philosophy that you may not understand completely now.",
            "Jai:How does one God become so many things in the universe?",
            "Grandma:According to the Samkhya theory of creation, Gods energy (Atma or Spirit) itself becomes Nature or matter, made up of the five basic elements. The entire creation is born and sustained by different combinations of these two energies: Spirit and Matter. (Gita 7.06) He is in the form of light in the Sun and the Moon; He is in the form of mind and strength in human beings. He digests our food and supports our life. We are all connected by the same Spirit as jewels in a necklace are connected by the same thread. (Gita 7.07)",
            "Jai:If God is everywhere and in everything, why doesnt everyone understand and love and worship Him?",
            "Grandma:That is a good question, Jai. Generally, people have a false idea of God because everyone is not given the power to understand Him. Just as some people cant understand calculus or even elementary mathematics, so people who have no good Karma, cant know, understand, love, or worship God.",
            "Jai:Then who are the ones who understand God?",
            "Grandma:There are four types of people who worship or seek to understand God: (1) those who are sick or in some kind of trouble or seek help in doing well in their studies or work, (2) those who are trying to get the knowledge of God, (3) those who want money, and (4) the wise ones who know God. (Gita 7.16) Lord Krishna considers all four types of people as devotees. The wise one is the best because a wise person worships God without wanting anything from Him. Even such wise ones completely know God only after many births. (Gita 7.19)",
            "Jai:If I worship Krishna, can I get good grades in an examination or get rid of sickness?",
            "Grandma:Yes, He fulfills the desires of all who believe in Him and who always worship and pray with firm faith.God is both our Father and Mother. You should ask God what you want in a prayer. He fulfills the desires of His sincere devotees. (Gita 7.21)",
            "Jai:Then why doesnt everybody worship Krishna? Why do we worship Lord Ganesha, Shri Hanumana, Mother Sarasvati and many other deities?",
            "Grandma:Lord Krishna is the name of the Supreme God. Some sects of Hinduism call the Supreme God as Lord Shiva.People of other religions call Him Buddha, Jesus, Allah, Father, etc. Other deities (gods) are a part of His power. Just as all rain water goes to the ocean, so worship of any deity goes to Krishna, the Absolute. But a beginner should chose just one of the many deities and establish a personal relationship by doing Pooja, or at least Namaskara, everyday to the chosen deity. The personal deity then becomes your personal guide and protector. The personal deity is called IshtaDeva or IshtaDevi, your personal god.",

            "Grandma:This big question not only confuses children, but also puzzles adults. Answers to this question created various sects or groups in Hinduism. One sect, called Arya Samaj, believes that God cannot have forms and is formless. Another group believes God has a form. A third group believes God is formless and takes forms. Still others believe God is both with form and without form.",
            "I believe everything has a form. Nothing in the world is formless. God has a form, which is invisible to our physical eyes. He cannot be understood by the human mind or described by words. Supreme Being has a transcendental (or out of this world) form and a Supreme Personality. He has no origin but is the origin of everything. He has no beginning or end. The invisible God is the cause of the visible world. Invisible does not mean formless. Everything we see is another form of God.",

            "The mahout (trainer) of the elephant shouted: Run away! Run away!",
            "But the disciple didnt move. The animal grabbed him with its trunk, threw him to one side, and went on its way. The disciple lay unconscious on the ground. Hearing what had happened; his god-brothers came to him and carried him to the hermitage. With the help of some herbal medicine, he regained consciousness.",
            "Then someone asked, When you knew the mad elephant was coming, why didnt you leave the place?",
            "He answered: Our guru has taught us that God is in all beings, animals as well as human. Therefore, I thought it was only the elephant-god that was coming, so I didnt run away.",
            "At this the guru said: Yes, my child, it is true that the elephant-god was coming; but the mahout-god asked you to get out of way. Why didnt you trust the mahouts words? Also, the elephant-god does not have the Self-knowledge that all are God!",

Once when the deer was absent, Maharaja Bharata was so disturbed that he began to search for it. While searching and lamenting the deer's absence, Maharaja Bharata fell down and died.

Everything is just another form of God. Knowing this, we can see God all around us. The entire universe is God, and we are His children and tools. (Gita 11.33) God uses us to do His work.

His body had no beginning or end. Bright light was shining all around Him. Arjuna also saw all his cousins, along with many other kings and warriors, quickly entering into Lords fearful mouths for destruction. This cosmic form of Krishna was very frightful to see, so Arjuna wished to see Krishna in the four-armed Vishnu form with a crown, holding a conch, discus, club and lotus in His hands. Krishna then showed His four-armed Vishnu form to Arjuna.",

We have eleven senses: five sense organs (nose, tongue, eye, skin, and ear); five organs of action (mouth, hand, leg, anus, and urethra); and a mind. We smell through our nose, taste through our tongue, see through the eyes, feel touch through skin, and hear through our ears. We also have a sense of feeling by which we feel pain and pleasure. All these give our body what it needs to work. (Gita 13.05-06) The Spirit or Atma inside our bodies is also called Prana. It supplies power to the body to do all work. When Prana leaves the body, we are dead.",

He can see, feel, and enjoy without any physical sense organs. He does not have a body like us. His body and senses are out of this world. He walks without legs, hears without ears, does all works without hands, smells without a nose, sees without eyes, speaks without a mouth, and enjoys all tastes without a tongue. His actions are wonderful. His greatness is beyond description. God is present everywhere at all times, so He is very near (living in our heart) as well as far away in His Supreme Abode.

Now, no one could report the oceans depth. Thats how impossible it is for anyone to describe God. Whenever we try, we melt into the big, mysterious ocean of His reality.",

This means one does not retain the memory of experiences in trance (Samadhi). One who knows Brahma becomes Brahma-like (Gita 18.55) and does not talk, just as the salt doll melted into the ocean and could not report the oceans depth. Those who talk about God have no real experience. Thus, Brahma can only be experienced and felt.",

One and the same God lives in the body of all beings as spirit and supports us. That is why we must not hurt anybody and must treat everybody equally.

The difference between the creator and creation is like the difference between the sun and the suns rays. Those who have Self-knowledge truly understand the difference between the creator and the creation and become God-realized.

Sometimes one mode becomes more powerful than the other two.",

When you are in the mode of passion, you become greedy for wealth and power. You will work hard to enjoy material pleasures and will do anything to satisfy your selfish desires. When you are in the mode of ignorance, you cant tell the difference between right and wrong action, and will do sinful and forbidden activities. You become lazy and careless, lack intelligence, and have no interest in spiritual knowledge. (Gita 14.05-09)",

If you are under the mode of ignorance, you must stop being lazy, stop putting off what you should be doing, and start helping others. This will bring you to the mode of goodness. If you are under the mode of passion, you must give up being selfish and greedy and help others. This will bring you to the mode of goodness. After reaching the mode of goodness, you can rise above the three Gunas by devotion to God. Lord Krishna said: One who serves Me with love and devotion rises above the three Gunas and becomes fit for God-realization. (Gita 14.26)",

            "Grandma:Full faith in God makes things happen. There is nothing impossible for faith. Faith works miracles. One must have faith before starting any work. It is said in the Gita that we can become whatever we want to be if we always think about it and pray to God with faith. (Gita 17.03) Always think about what you want to be, and your dream can come true.",
            "Here is a story about a crow that had faith.",
            "23. The Thirsty Crow",
            "It was a hot summer day. A crow was very thirsty. He flew from place to place looking for water. He could not find water anywhere. Ponds, rivers, and lakes were all dry. The water in the well was too deep. Crow was very thirsty for water. He flew and flew. He was getting both tired and thirsty, but he did not give up the search.",
            "At last he thought death was near and remembered God and started to pray for water. He saw a pitcher of water near a house. This made him very happy as he thought there must be water in the pitcher. He sat on the top of the pitcher and looked into it. To his great frustration he found that the water was at the bottom of the pitcher. He could see the water, but his beak could not reach the water. He became very sad and started to think how he could reach the water. Suddenly an idea came into his mind. There were stones near the pitcher. He picked up stones from the ground, one by one, and started dropping them into the pitcher. The water began coming up. Soon the crow could reach it easily. He drank the water, thanked God, and happily flew away.",
            "Thus it is said, Where there is a will, there is a way. The crow did what we all should do. He did not give up. He had faith that his prayer would be answered.",
            "Here is another good story:",
            "24. The Rabbit and the Turtle",
            "A turtle always moves very slowly. His friend, the rabbit, often laughed at the slow turtle. One day, the turtle could not bear the insults and challenged the rabbit to run a race with him. All the animals in the jungle laughed at the idea because a race is usually between equals. A deer volunteered to be the judge.",
            "The race started. The rabbit ran fast, and soon he was ahead of the turtle. As the rabbit came closer and closer to the winning post, he felt sure of winning. He looked back at the slow moving turtle, who was far behind.",
            "The rabbit was so sure of winning that he thought, I will sit under the tree and wait for the turtle. When he comes here, I shall run fast and cross the finish line before he does. This will make turtle angry, and it will be fun to see the turtle insulted.",
            "The rabbit then sat under a tree. The turtle was still far behind. A cool wind was blowing gently. After some time passed, the rabbit fell asleep. When he woke up, he saw the turtle crossing the finish line. The rabbit had lost the race! All the animals in the jungle were laughing at the rabbit, and he learned a valuable lesson:",
            "Here is a story of a man who learned that God helps those who help themselves.",
            "25. A Man Who Never Gave Up",
            "Yava was the son of a sage who practiced hard penance to get the blessings of Indra, the King of Devas. He tortured his body with austerities and thus awakened the sympathy of Indra. Indra came before him and asked why he was hurting his body.",
            "Yava answered: I wish to be a great scholar of the Vedas. It takes a long time to learn the Vedas from a teacher. I am practicing austerities to get that knowledge directly. Bless me.",
            "Indra smiled and said: Son, you are on the wrong path. Return home, find a good teacher, and learn the Vedas from him. Austerity is not the way to learn; the path is study and study alone. With these words, Indra went away.",
            "But Yava would not give up. He did his course of spiritual practice (austerities, penance) with even greater effort. Indra again came before Yava and warned him again. Yava announced that if his prayer was not answered, he would cut off his arms and legs one by one and offer them to the fire. No, he would never give up. He continued his penance. One morning, during his austerities, when he went to bathe in the holy Ganga River, he saw an old man on the bank throwing handfuls of sand into the river.",
            "Old man, what are you doing? asked Yava.",
            "The old man replied: I am going to build a dam across the river so people can cross the river easily. See how difficult it is now to cross it. Useful work, isnt it? ",
            "Yava laughed and said: What a fool you must be to think you can build a dam across this mighty river with your handfuls of sand! Go home and do some other useful work.",
            "The old man said: Is my work more foolish than yours of learning the Vedas, not by study, but by austerities?",
            "Yava now knew that the old man was Indra. Yava earnestly begged Indra to grant him learning as a personal wish.",
            "Indra blessed him and comforted Yava with the following words: I grant you the wish you want. Go and read the Vedas; you will become learned.",
            "Yava studied the Vedas and became a great scholar of the Vedas.",
            "The secret of success is to keep thinking about what you want all the time and never give up until you get what you want. Do not let negative thoughts, such as delaying to start work, laziness, and carelessness stand in your way.",
            "Before starting or ending any work or study, repeat OM TAT SAT, the threefold names of Brahma.",
            "Jai:What does OM TAT SAT mean, Grandma?",
            "Grandma:It means Krishna, the Almighty God, only exists. OM is used before starting any work or study. OM TAT SAT or OM Shantih, Shantih, Shantih, is also used at the end of any act."
