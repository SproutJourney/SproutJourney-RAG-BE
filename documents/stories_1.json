The animals, distressed and scared, came together to discuss how they could protect themselves from the lion's wrath.After much discussion, they approached the lion with a proposal. They promised to send one animal to him every day as his meal, so he wouldnt have to hunt and kill randomly. The lion agreed to the proposal, and the killing spree stopped. Each day, one animal was sent to the lion's den, where it would meet its end.One day, it was a clever hares turn to be sacrificed. The hare, not wanting to die, came up with a plan. Instead of heading straight to the lions den, he wandered around and made sure to arrive late. The lion, hungry and impatient, roared at the hare, demanding to know why he was late.The hare bowed and said, \"Oh mighty king, I am sorry for being late. I was on my way here, but another lion stopped me. He claimed to be the king of this forest and wanted to eat me. But I managed to escape and come here to serve you.\" The lion, furious at the thought of another lion claiming his territory, demanded to be taken to this intruder.The hare led the lion to a deep well and said, \"The other lion is hiding inside this well.\" The lion peered into the well and saw his own reflection in the water. Thinking it was the other lion, he roared in anger. The reflection roared back, which made the lion even more furious. In his rage, the lion jumped into the well to attack the intruder, only to drown in the deep water.The hare, pleased with his cleverness, returned to the other animals and told them how he had rid the forest of the cruel lion. The animals celebrated their newfound freedom, and the hare became a hero in the forest.",

The mango tree was known for its delicious and sweet fruits, while the tamarind tree was famous for its sour fruits. The two trees were friends but had very different personalities.The mango tree was humble, kind, and always bent its branches to offer its fruits to the people and animals that passed by. The tamarind tree, on the other hand, was proud and arrogant. It stood tall and rigid, refusing to bend its branches for anyone, believing that its sour fruits were more precious than the sweet mangoes.One day, a fierce storm hit the village. The winds howled and the rain poured down heavily. The mango tree, being flexible, bent with the wind and allowed the storm to pass through its branches without causing much damage. But the tamarind tree, with its rigid stance, stood firm against the wind. The wind grew stronger and stronger until, finally, the tamarind tree could no longer withstand it. With a loud crack, the tamarind tree was uprooted and fell to the ground.The next morning, when the storm had passed, the villagers came out to assess the damage. They found the mango tree standing tall and proud, with only a few branches broken. But the tamarind tree lay on the ground, its roots exposed and its trunk broken. The villagers realized that the mango trees humility and flexibility had saved it from the storm, while the tamarind trees arrogance had led to its downfall.",
